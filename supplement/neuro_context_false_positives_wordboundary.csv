29434374,mTOR,neurodegeneration,Reactive oxygen species regulate axonal regeneration through the release of exosomal NADPH oxidase 2 complexes into injured axons.,4,include_primary_high,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to tissue damage and remodelling mediated by the inflammatory response after injury. Here we show that ROS, which promote axonal dieback and degeneration after injury, are also required for axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal injury. We find that ROS production in the injured sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia requires CX3CR1-dependent recruitment of inflammatory cells. Next, exosomes containing functional NADPH oxidase 2 complexes are released from macrophages and incorporated into injured axons via endocytosis. Once in axonal endosomes, active NOX2 is retrogradely transported to the cell body through an importin-β1-dynein-dependent mechanism. Endosomal NOX2 oxidizes PTEN, which leads to its inactivation, thus stimulating PI3K-phosporylated (p-)Akt signalling and regenerative outgrowth. Challenging the view that ROS are exclusively involved in nerve degeneration, we propose a previously unrecognized role of ROS in mammalian axonal regeneration through a NOX2-PI3K-p-Akt signalling pathway."

37957914,mTOR,neurodegeneration,The miR-210 Primed Endothelial Progenitor Cell Exosomes Alleviate Acute Ischemic Brain Injury.,4,include_primary_high,"Stem cell-released exosomes (EXs) have shown beneficial effects on regenerative diseases. Our previous study has revealed that EXs of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC-EXs) can elicit favorable effects on endothelial function. EXs may vary greatly in size, composition, and cargo uptake rate depending on the origins and stimulus; notably, EXs are promising vehicles for delivering microRNAs (miRs). Since miR-210 is known to protect cerebral endothelial cell mitochondria by reducing oxidative stress, here we study the effects of miR-210-loaded EPC-EXs (miR210-EPC-EXs) on ischemic brain damage in acute ischemic stroke (IS). The miR210-EPC-EXs were generated from EPCs transfected with miR-210 mimic. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed to induce acute IS in C57BL/6 mice. EPC-EXs or miR210-EPC-EXs were administrated via tail vein injection 2 hrs after IS. To explore the potential mechanisms, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)/PI3 kinase (PI3K) or tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB)/PI3k pathways were used. The brain tissue was collected after treatments for infarct size, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and protein expression (VEGFR2, TrkB) analyses on day two. The neurological deficit score (NDS) was evaluated before collecting the samples. 1) As compared to EPC-EXs, miR210-EPC-EXs profoundly reduced the infarct volume and improved the NDS on day two post-IS. 2) Fewer apoptosis cells were detected in the peri-infarct brain of mice treated with miR210-EPC-EXs than in EPC-EXs-treated mice. Meanwhile, the oxidative stress was profoundly reduced by miR210-EPC-EXs. 3) The ratios of p-PI3k/PI3k, p- VEGFR2/VEGFR2, and p-TrkB/TrkB in the ipsilateral brain were raised by miR210-EPC-EXs treatment. These effects could be significantly blocked or partially inhibited by PI3k, VEGFR2, or TrkB pathway inhibitors. These findings suggest that miR210-EPC-EXs protect the brain from acute ischemia- induced cell apoptosis and oxidative stress partially through the VEGFR2/PI3k and TrkB/PI3k signal pathways."
27392863,mTOR,neurodegeneration,Amyloid-β Reduces Exosome Release from Astrocytes by Enhancing JNK Phosphorylation.,3,include_contextual,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by variety of cell types such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. It is suggested that exosomes play essential role in the maintenance of the neuronal functions and also in the clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) from the brain. Aβ is well known to cause neuronal cell death, whereas little is known about its effect on astrocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of Aβ on release of exosomes from astrocytes in culture. We analyzed release of exosomes and apoE, both of which are known to remove/clear Aβ from the brain, in the culture medium of astrocytes. We found that exosome and apoE-HDL were successfully separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation demonstrated by distribution of their specific markers, flotillin and HSP90, and cholesterol, and morphological analysis using electron microscopy. Exosome release was significantly reduced by Aβ1-42 treatment in cultured astrocytes accompanied by an increased JNK phosphorylation. Whereas, apoE-HDL release remained unchanged. A JNK inhibitor restored the decreased levels of exosome release induced by Aβ treatment to levels similar to those of control, suggesting that Aβ1-42 inhibits exosome release via stimulation of JNK signal pathway. Because exosomes are shown to remove Aβ in the brain, our findings suggest that increased Aβ levels in the brain may impair the exosome-mediated Aβ clearance pathway."
35022057,mTOR,neurodegeneration,Extracellular vesicles derived from glioblastoma promote proliferation and migration of neural progenitor cells via PI3K-Akt pathway.,4,include_primary_high,"Glioblastomas are lethal brain tumors under the current combinatorial therapeutic strategy that includes surgery, chemo- and radio-therapies. Extensive changes in the tumor microenvironment is a key reason for resistance to chemo- or radio-therapy and frequent tumor recurrences. Understanding the tumor-nontumor cell interaction in TME is critical for developing new therapy. Glioblastomas are known to recruit normal cells in their environs to sustain growth and encroachment into other regions. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have been noted to migrate towards the site of glioblastomas, however, the detailed mechanisms underlying glioblastoma-mediated NPCs' alteration remain unkown. We collected EVs in the culture medium of three classic glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and A172 (male cell lines), and LN229 (female cell line). U87, A172, and LN229 were co-cultured with their corresponding EVs, respectively. Mouse NPCs (mNPCs) were co-cultured with glioblastoma-derived EVs. The proliferation and migration of tumor cells and mNPCs after EVs treatment were examined. Proteomic analysis and western blotting were utilized to identify the underlying mechanisms of glioblastoma-derived EVs-induced alterations in mNPCs. We first show that glioblastoma cell lines U87-, A172-, and LN229-derived EVs were essential for glioblastoma cell prolifeartion and migration. We then demonstrated that glioblastoma-derived EVs dramatically promoted NPC proliferation and migration. Mechanistic studies identify that glioblastoma-derived EVs achieve their functions via activating PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in mNPCs. Inhibiting PI3K-Akt pathway reversed the elevated prolfieration and migration of glioblastoma-derived EVs-treated mNPCs. Our findings demonstrate that EVs play a key role in intercellular communication in tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of the tumorgenic EVs-mediated PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation might be a novel strategy to shed light on glioblastoma therapy. Video Abstract."
37108817,Wnt,neurodegeneration,Inflammatory Response and Exosome Biogenesis of Choroid Plexus Organoids Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.,4,include_primary_high,"The choroid plexus (ChP) is a complex structure in the human brain that is responsible for the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forming the blood-CSF barrier (B-CSF-B). Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have shown promising results in the formation of brain organoids in vitro; however, very few studies to date have generated ChP organoids. In particular, no study has assessed the inflammatory response and the extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis of hiPSC-derived ChP organoids. In this study, the impacts of Wnt signaling on the inflammatory response and EV biogenesis of ChP organoids derived from hiPSCs was investigated. During days 10-15, bone morphogenetic protein 4 was added along with (+/-) CHIR99021 (CHIR, a small molecule GSK-3β inhibitor that acts as a Wnt agonist). At day 30, the ChP organoids were characterized by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry for TTR (~72%) and CLIC6 (~20%) expression. Compared to the -CHIR group, the +CHIR group showed an upregulation of 6 out of 10 tested ChP genes, including"
28954226,Wnt,neurodegeneration,Intra-axonal Synthesis of SNAP25 Is Required for the Formation of Presynaptic Terminals.,2,include_contextual,"Localized protein synthesis is a mechanism for developing axons to react acutely and in a spatially restricted manner to extracellular signals. As such, it is important for many aspects of axonal development, but its role in the formation of presynapses remains poorly understood. We found that the induced assembly of presynaptic terminals required local protein synthesis. Newly synthesized proteins were detectable at nascent presynapses within 15 min of inducing synapse formation in isolated axons. The transcript for the t-SNARE protein SNAP25, which is required for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, was recruited to presynaptic sites and locally translated. Inhibition of intra-axonal SNAP25 synthesis affected the clustering of SNAP25 and other presynaptic proteins and interfered with the release of synaptic vesicles from presynaptic sites. This study reveals a critical role for the axonal synthesis of SNAP25 in the assembly of presynaptic terminals."
40855286,Wnt,neurodegeneration,Targeted neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles loaded with Sinomenine alleviate diabetic peripheral neuropathy via WNT5a/TRPV1 pathway modulation.,4,include_primary_high,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating complications of diabetes, marked by chronic neuroinflammation, immune dysregulation, and progressive neuronal degeneration. Current treatments offer limited efficacy, largely focusing on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. There is a critical need for disease-modifying therapies that target the molecular basis of DPN. In this study, we developed a novel targeted nanotherapeutic system-ZH-1c-EVs@SIN-composed of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) modified with the ZH-1c aptamer and loaded with the anti-inflammatory compound sinomenine (SIN). This system was specifically designed to target microglia and inhibit the WNT5a/TRPV1 signaling pathway. Transcriptomic profiling of microglia revealed key gene networks implicated in DPN pathology and responsive to SIN treatment. Functional assays demonstrated that ZH-1c-EVs@SIN facilitated a shift in microglial phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2, significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, and restored levels of neuronal regulatory proteins. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed optimal vesicle size and morphology, while fluorescence imaging showed efficient uptake by microglia. In vivo studies in a murine model of DPN revealed marked improvements in pain-related behavior and histopathological signs of nerve damage. ZH-1c-EVs@SIN represents a promising therapeutic strategy for DPN, offering targeted immunomodulation and enhanced neural repair via regulation of the WNT5a/TRPV1 signaling axis. This nano-delivery platform introduces a novel and precise approach to intervening in diabetic neuropathy and may be applicable to other neuroinflammatory conditions."
29751779,Wnt,neurodegeneration,Essential role of ATP6AP2 enrichment in caveolae/lipid raft microdomains for the induction of neuronal differentiation of stem cells.,4,include_primary_high,"The subcellular distribution of prorenin receptor and adaptor protein ATP6AP2 may affect neurogenesis. In this study, we hypothesized that ATP6AP2 expression and subcellular relocalization from caveolae/lipid raft microdomains (CLR-Ms) to intracellular sites may correlate with neuronal differentiation (Neu-Dif) of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). Human ADSCs isolated from 24 healthy donors and 24 patients with neurological disorders (ND) were cultured and induced for Neu-Dif. The mechanism of action of ATP6AP2 and the impact of its localization within the plasma membrane (particularly CLR-Ms) and intracellular sites on several pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt(s) signaling and others) and intracellular calcium and exosome release were evaluated. The impact of CLR-Ms on ATP6AP2 or vice versa was determined by pharmacological disruption of CLR-Ms or siATP6AP2 assays. In patients with ND, loss of ATP6AP2 from CLR-Ms correlated with an inhibition of Neu-Dif and signaling. However, its relocalization in CLR-Ms was positively correlated to induction of Neu-Dif in healthy subjects. An apparent switch from canonical to noncanonical Wnt signaling as well as from caveolin to flotillin occurs concurrently with the increases of ATP6AP2 expression during neurogenesis. Stimulation by renin activates ERK/JNK/CREB/c-Jun but failed to induce β-catenin. Wnt5a enhanced the renin-induced JNK responsiveness. Gα proteins crosslink ATP6AP2 to caveolin where a switch from Gαi to Gαq is necessary for Neu-Dif. In ATP6AP2-enriched CLR-Ms, the release of exosomes was induced dependently from the intracellular Ca This study gives evidence of the determinant role of CLR-M ATP6AP2 localization for neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation involving mechanisms of switches from Gαi/caveolin/canonical to Gαq/flotillin/PCP, the ERK/JNK pathway and Ca"

Cells from both the peripheral and central immune systems significantly impact the development of cerebral small vessel disease. By analyzing the effects of different immune cells on brain dysfunction associated with this disease, we aim to explore the various mechanisms through which autoimmune and acquired immune cells in peripheral circulation and the central nervous system contribute to disease development. Additionally, we seek to identify potential therapeutic modalities targeting these immune cells. In innate immunity, treatment targeting different monocyte loci includes four main modalities: cytokines (CSF1R, MIF, P2X7, CX3CR1, and CCL2), signaling pathways (DAP12/TREM, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin), tissue engineering (mitochondrial transplantation and exosomes), and traditional Chinese medicines. Treatment targeting different dendritic cell loci encompasses two modalities: signaling pathway (cGAS/STING/NF-κB) and tissue engineering (tolerogenic dendritic cells and engineered probiotics). For natural killer cells, treatment targeting different loci includes two modalities: tissue engineering (natural killer cell-based immunotherapies) and traditional Chinese medicines (Tongxinluo capsule). In adaptive immunity, treatment targeting different T cell loci includes four modalities: cytokines (S1PR and RXR), signaling pathway (Nrf2/GPX4 and Notch-ITGB1), tissue engineering (elimination of senescent T cells, monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta protofibrils, nanovaccines, and nanomedicines), and traditional Chinese medicines (traditional herbal remedies and microneedle therapy). Treatment targeting different B cell loci includes three modalities: monoclonal antibodies (targeting CD49d and CD20), purine glycoside analogs (Cladribine), and plasma exchange. This review explores the relationship between nerve regeneration, immune cells, and cerebral small vessel disease. The disease is characterized by the crucial role played by signaling and interactions between immune cells and components of the neurovascular unit, which is a functional complex composed of neurons, glial cells, and microvessels that regulate inflammatory responses and tissue repair. The central nervous system lacks intrinsic regenerative capacity, and currently, there is no effective method to fully restore its function. The primary focus of current research is on utilizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to create environments that facilitate cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Hydrogels, induced pluripotent stem cells, exosomes, regulatory T cell transplants, and gene modification are key areas of focus in neural regeneration research. In the future, immune rejuvenation and other emerging therapies may offer potential treatment strategies for cerebral small vessel disease. This review analyzes the functions of various immune cells in cerebral small vessel disease, explores the relationship between nerve regeneration and these immune cells, and discusses potential therapeutic avenues that target immune cells for future treatments and neural regeneration related to cerebral small vessel disease."

Here we report that ARMMs contain active NOTCH receptors and mediate a non-canonical intercellular NOTCH signaling. We identify over 100 proteins that are significantly enriched in ARMMs, including ARRDC1, TSG101 and multiple ESCRT complex proteins. About a third of ARMMs-enriched proteins are plasma membrane proteins, including the NOTCH2 receptor. The incorporation of NOTCH2 into ARMMs is facilitated by the ITCH E3 ligase and the metalloprotease ADAM10, both of which are also secreted into ARMMs. NOTCH2 in ARMMs can be delivered into recipient cells, and upon activation by γ-secretase cleavage, induces NOTCH-specific gene expression. Together, our findings reveal a role for ARMMs in a novel NOTCH signaling pathway that acts in distance and is independent of direct cell-cell contact.ARMMs are extracellular vesicles that bud directly at the plasma membrane; their function is poorly understood. Here the authors purify and carryout a proteomics analysis of the protein components of ARMMs, and show that NOTCH receptors are recruited into ARMMs and can be transferred to recipient cells to mediate NOTCH signaling."

Recapitulating human CRB1 phenotypes in animal models has proven challenging, necessitating the development of alternatives. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal organoids of patients with retinitis pigmentosa caused by biallelic CRB1 mutations and evaluated them against autologous gene-corrected hiPSCs and hiPSCs from healthy individuals. Patient organoids show decreased levels of CRB1 and NOTCH1 expression at the retinal outer limiting membrane. Proximity ligation assays show that human CRB1 and NOTCH1 can interact via their extracellular domains. CRB1 patient organoids feature increased levels of WDFY1+ vesicles, fewer RAB11A+ recycling endosomes, decreased VPS35 retromer complex components, and more degradative endolysosomal compartments relative to isogenic control organoids. Taken together, our data demonstrate that patient-derived retinal organoids enable modeling of retinal degeneration and highlight the importance of CRB1 in early endosome maturation receptor recycling in the retina."

Major pathological features of alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) include alterations in WM integrity with myelin loss, and cerebellar degeneration with neuronal loss. This study characterizes molecular and biochemical oligodendrocyte-related pathology in cerebellar tissue from donors with AUD to better understand the mechanisms of ARBD in humans. Cores of cerebellar vermis, including cortex and underlying WM from adult human postmortem AUD and control brains, were processed for RNA and protein analyses using duplex and multiplex panels. AUD cerebellar WM had significant alterations in immature and mature oligodendrocyte protein and mRNA expression, and reduced expression of hepatocyte growth factor, Akt and GSK-3β signaling molecules, and Notch pathway activation. Moreover, the only significant AUD-related alteration in cerebellar cytokine/chemokine expression was reduced IL-16 immunoreactivity. Human AUD WM degeneration is associated with oligodendrocyte dysfunction, which mechanistically could be mediated by impairments in insulin/IGF signaling through Akt/GSK-3β or Notch pathway activation. Future studies should focus on the non-invasive detection and monitoring of AUD-related oligodendrocyte pathology through the analysis of cell-type-specific exosomes isolated from peripheral blood."

36367475,NF-kB,neurodegeneration,Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles attenuate tPA-induced blood-brain barrier disruption in murine ischemic stroke models.,3,include_contextual,"Intracerebral hemorrhage following blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption resulting from thrombolysis of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains a critical clinical problem. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are promising nanotherapeutic agents that have the potential to repair the BBB after ischemic stroke; however, whether they can attenuate BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation after tPA thrombolysis is largely unknown. Here, we observed that MSC-EVs efficiently passed through the BBB and selectively accumulated in injured brain regions in ischemic stroke model mice in real time using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), which exhibit better tracking ability than the commercially available tracer DiR. Moreover, tPA administration promoted the homing of MSC-EVs to the ischemic brain and increased the uptake of MSC-EVs by astrocytes. Furthermore, the accumulated MSC-EVs attenuated the tPA-induced disruption of BBB integrity and alleviated hemorrhage by inhibiting astrocyte activation and inflammation. Mechanistically, miR-125b-5p delivered by MSC-EVs played an indispensable role in maintaining BBB integrity by targeting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibiting nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in astrocytes. This study provides a noninvasive method for real-time tracking of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain after tPA treatment and highlights the potential of MSC-EVs as thrombolytic adjuvants for ischemic stroke. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although tPA thrombolysis is the most effective pharmaceutical strategy for acute ischemic stroke, its clinical application and therapeutic efficacy are challenged by tPA-induced BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. Our study demonstrated that MSC-EVs can act as an attractive thrombolytic adjuvant to repair the BBB and improve thrombolysis in a mouse ischemic stroke model. Notably, by labeling MSC-EVs with AIEgens, we achieved accurate real-time imaging of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain and therapeutic visualization. MSC-EVs inhibit astrocyte activation and associated inflammation through miR-125b-5p/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Consequently, we revealed that MSC-EVs combined with tPA thrombolysis may be a promising approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinical setting."

Here, we show that pTau primes and activates IL-1β. First, RNA-sequence analysis suggests paired-helical filaments (PHFs) from human tauopathy brain primes nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), chemokine, and IL-1β signaling clusters in human primary microglia. Treating microglia with pTau-containing neuronal media, exosomes, or PHFs causes IL-1β activation, which is NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 dependent. Suppression of pTau or ASC reduces tau pathology and inflammasome activation in rTg4510 and hTau mice, respectively. Although the deletion of MyD88 prevents both IL-1β expression and activation in the hTau mouse model of tauopathy, ASC deficiency in myeloid cells reduces pTau-induced IL-1β activation and improves cognitive function in hTau mice. Finally, pTau burden co-exists with elevated IL-1β and ASC in autopsy brains of human tauopathies. Together, our results suggest pTau activates IL-1β via MyD88- and NLRP3-ASC-dependent pathways in myeloid cells, including microglia."

Among proposed contributors to viral latency are cellular small RNAs that have also been proposed to shuttle between cells in extracellular vesicles. Thus, we profiled extracellular vesicle small RNAs during different infection phases to understand the potential relationship between these extracellular vesicle associated small RNAs and viral infection. A well characterized simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of HIV was used to profile extracellular vesicle enriched blood plasma fractions harvested during preinfection, acute infection, latent infection/ART treatment, and rebound after ART interruption. Measurement of extracellular vesicle concentration, size distribution, and morphology was complemented with qPCR array for small RNA expression, followed by individual qPCR validations. Iodixanol density gradients were used to separate extracellular vesicle subtypes and virions. Plasma extracellular vesicle particle counts correlated with viral load and peaked during acute infection. However, SIV gag RNA detection showed that virions did not fully explain this peak. Extracellular vesicle microRNAs miR-181a, miR-342-3p, and miR-29a decreased with SIV infection and remained downregulated in latency. Interestingly, small nuclear RNA U6 had a tight association with viral load peak. This study is the first to monitor how extracellular vesicle concentration and extracellular vesicle small RNA expression change dynamically in acute viral infection, latency, and rebound in a carefully controlled animal model. These changes may also reveal regulatory roles in retroviral infection and latency."

All sTBI subjects (n = 24) had mild injuries, whereas eight of the mtTBI subjects had moderate, and 17 had mild injuries. Plasma levels of ADEs were decreased after acute sTBI and returned to normal within months. Cprotein levels in ADEs were from 12- to 35-fold higher than the corresponding levels in neuron-derived exosomes. CD81 exosome marker-normalized ADE levels of classical pathway C4b, alternative pathway factor D and Bb, lectin pathway mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and shared neurotoxic effectors C3b and C5b-9 terminal C complex were significantly higher and those of C regulatory proteins CR1 and CD59 were lower in the first week of acute sTBI (n = 12) than in controls (n = 12). Most C abnormalities were no longer detected in chronic sTBI at 3-12 months after acute sTBI, except for elevated levels of factor D, Bb, and MBL. In contrast, significant elevations of ADE levels of C4b, factor D, Bb, MBL, C3b and C5b-9 terminal C complex, and depressions of CR1 and CD59 relative to those of controls were observed after 1-4 years in early chronic mtTBI (n = 10) and persisted for decades except for normalization of Bb, MBL, and CD59 in late chronic mtTBI (n = 15). Complement inhibitors may be useful therapeutically in acute TBI and post-concussion syndrome."

Exosomes were discovered almost 40 years ago; however, the last two decades have attracted considerable attention due to exosomes' inherent abilities to shuttle nucleic acids, lipids and proteins between cells, along with their natural affinity to exosome target cells. From a pharmaceutical perspective, exosomes are regarded as naturally produced nanoparticle drug delivery vehicles. The application of exosomes as a means of drug delivery offers critical advantages compared to other nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles. These advantages are due to the exosomes' intrinsic features, such as low immunogenicity, biocompatibility, stability, and their ability to overcome biological barriers. Herein, we outline the structure and origin of exosomes, as well as their biological functions. We also touch upon recent advances in exosome labeling, imaging and drug loading. Finally, we discuss exosomes in targeted drug delivery and clinical trial development."

In this review, we summarize the current evidence from studies on SLs (particularly gangliosides), which may shed new light upon processes underlying the MS background. The relevant aspects of these studies include alterations of the SL profile in MS, the role of antibodies against SLs and complexes of SL-ligand-invariant NKT cells in the autoimmune response as the core pathomechanism in MS. The contribution of lipid-raft-associated SLs and SL-laden extracellular vesicles to the disease etiology is also discussed. These findings may have diagnostic implications, with SLs and anti-SL antibodies as potential markers of MS activity and progression. Intriguing prospects of novel therapeutic options in MS are associated with SL potential for myelin repair and neuroprotective effects, which have not been yet addressed by the available treatment strategies. Overall, all these concepts are promising and encourage the further development of SL-based studies in the field of MS."

The canonical pathway for generating EVs involves the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, but an alternative pathway is induced by the enrichment of lipid membrane ceramides generated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2). Inhibition of nSMase2 has become an attractive therapeutic strategy for inhibiting EV biogenesis, and a growing number of small-molecule nSMase2 inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic activity in preclinical disease models. This review outlines the function of EVs, their potential role in disease, the discovery and efficacy of nSMase2 inhibitors, and the path to translate these findings into therapeutics."

Although SLs and their related biomolecules behave as lipid mediators, skin barrier systems, and epitopes, their detailed biological functions have not yet been revealed, unlike those of proteins and nucleic acids, because the biosynthesis of SLs is not governed by the central dogma. Recently, SLs have been widely studied in relation to diseases such as obesity, dementia, and neuron agenesis and have attracted attention as molecules related to unmet medical needs. This review presents the recent applications of the SL chemical biology in unmet medical needs."

As dopamine can be metabolized to reactive quinones, dopaminergic neurons are susceptible to oxidative damage and ferroptosis-like induced cell death. Detoxification enzymes are required to protect neurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in the regulation of redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 in astrocytes and metabolic cooperation between astrocytes and neurons. This article reviews the importance of BDNF and astrocyte-neuron interactions in the protection of neurons against oxidative damages in rodent brains. We previously proposed that BDNF activates Nrf2 via the truncated TrkB.T1 and p75"

However, little is known about the relationship of protein and lipid composition of EVs and their source cells. Here, we report high-resolution lipidomic and proteomic analyses of exosomes and MVs derived by differential ultracentrifugation from 3 different cell types: U87 glioblastoma cells, Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We identified 3,532 proteins and 1,961 lipid species in the screen. Exosomes differed from MVs in several different areas: (a) The protein patterns of exosomes were more likely different from their cells of origin than were the protein patterns of MVs; (b) The proteomes of U87 and Huh7 exosomes were similar to each other but different from the proteomes of MSC exosomes, whereas the lipidomes of Huh7 and MSC exosomes were similar to each other but different from the lipidomes of U87 exosomes; (c) exosomes exhibited proteins of extracellular matrix, heparin-binding, receptors, immune response and cell adhesion functions, whereas MVs were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, proteasome and mitochondrial proteins. Exosomes and MVs also differed in their types of lipid contents. Enrichment in glycolipids and free fatty acids characterized exosomes, whereas enrichment in ceramides and sphingomyelins characterized MVs. Furthermore, Huh7 and MSC exosomes were specifically enriched in cardiolipins; U87 exosomes were enriched in sphingomyelins. This study comprehensively analyses the protein and lipid composition of exosomes, MVs and source cells in 3 different cell types."

There currently exist three LAMP2 isoforms, LAMP2A, LAMP2B and LAMP2C, and they vary in distribution and function. LAMP2A serves as a receptor and channel for transporting cytosolic proteins in a process called chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). LAMP2B is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiomyocytes and is one of the components of exosome membranes. LAMP2C is primarily implicated in a novel type of autophagy in which nucleic acids are taken up into lysosomes for degradation. In this review, the current evidence for the function of each LAMP2 isoform in various pathophysiological processes and human diseases, as well as their possible mechanisms, are comprehensively summarized. We discuss the evolutionary patterns of the three isoforms in vertebrates and provide technical guidance on investigating these isoforms. We are also concerned with the newly arising questions in this particular research area that remain unanswered. Advances in the functions of the three LAMP2 isoforms will uncover new links between lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy and human diseases."
31972172,Autophagy,neurodegeneration,Autophagy and Protein Secretion.,3,include_contextual,"Autophagy - conventional for macroautophagy - is a major recycling strategy that ensures cellular homeostasis through the selective engulfment of cytoplasmic supramolecular cargos in double membrane vesicles and their rapid dispatch to the lysosome for digestion. As autophagy operates in the cytoplasm, its interference with secretory proteins, that is, proteins destined to the plasma membrane or the extracellular space, generally synthesized and routed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), has been relatively overlooked in the past. However, mounting evidence reveals that autophagy in fact heavily regulates protein secretion through diverse mechanisms. First, autophagy is closely involved in the unconventional secretion of leaderless proteins, a pool of proteins destined extracellularly, but lacking an ER-targeted leader sequence, and thus manufactured in the cytosol. Autophagy-related (ATG) genes now appear instrumental to the underlying pathways, hence the recently coined concept of secretory autophagy, or better ATG gene-dependent secretion. Indeed, ATG genes regulate unconventional protein secretion at multiple levels, ranging from intracellular inflammatory signaling, for example, through the control of mitochondrial health and inflammasome activity, to trafficking of leaderless proteins. Moreover, perhaps less expectedly, autophagy also participates in the control of conventional secretion, intersecting the secretory apparatus at multiple points, though with surprising differences among professional secretory cell types that disclose remarkable and unpredicted specificity. This review synopsizes the multiple mechanisms whereby autophagy interfaces with conventional and unconventional protein secretory pathways and discusses the relative teleology. Altogether, the diverse controls exerted on protein secretion broaden and deepen the homeostatic significance of autophagy within the cell."
33896112,Autophagy,neurodegeneration,Brain-specific functions of the endocytic machinery.,3,include_contextual,"Endocytosis is an essential cellular process required for multiple physiological functions, including communication with the extracellular environment, nutrient uptake, and signaling by the cell surface receptors. In a broad sense, endocytosis is accomplished through either constitutive or ligand-induced invagination of the plasma membrane, which results in the formation of the plasma membrane-retrieved endocytic vesicles, which can either be sent for degradation to the lysosomes or recycled back to the PM. This additional function of endocytosis in membrane retrieval has been adopted by excitable cells, such as neurons, for membrane equilibrium maintenance at synapses. The last two decades were especially productive with respect to the identification of brain-specific functions of the endocytic machinery, which additionally include but not limited to regulation of neuronal differentiation and migration, maintenance of neuron morphology and synaptic plasticity, and prevention of neurotoxic aggregates spreading. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of brain-specific functions of endocytic machinery with a specific focus on three brain cell types, neuronal progenitor cells, neurons, and glial cells."
36520306,Autophagy,neurodegeneration,Cdc37 as a Co-chaperone to Hsp90.,4,include_primary_high,"The co-chaperone p50/Cdc37 is an important partner for Hsp90, assisting in molecular chaperone activities, particularly with regard to the regulation of protein kinases. Analysis of the structure of Hsp90-Cdc37-kinase complexes demonstrates the way in which Cdc37 interacts with and controls the folding of a large proportion of intracellular protein kinases. This co-chaperone thus stands at the hub of a multitude of intracellular signaling networks. Indeed, the influence of Cdc37 reaches beyond the housekeeping pathways of protein folding into the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes. This co-chaperone has attracted attention as a potential intermediate in carcinogenesis. Cdc37 is an attractive potential target in cancer due to (1) high expression in a number of tumor types and (2) control of multiple signaling pathways. These properties indicate (3) a potential for selectivity due to its elevated expression in malignant cells and (4) robustness, as the co-chaperone may control multiple growth signaling pathways and thus be less prone to evolution of resistance than less versatile oncoproteins. Cdc37 may also be involved in other aspects of pathophysiology and has been shown to be secreted in exosomes. Protein aggregation disorders have been linked to age-related declines in molecular chaperones and co-chaperones. Cdc37 also appears to be a potential agent in longevity due to its links to protein folding and autophagy, and it will be informative to study the role of Cdc37 maintenance/decline in aging organisms."

Pericytes respond dynamically to vascular challenges; however, how they manifest under the continuous strain of hypertension has not been elucidated. In this study, we characterized pericyte behavior alongside hypertensive states in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat model, focusing on their phenotypic and metabolic transformation. Flow cytometry was used to characterize pericytes by their expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, neuroglial antigen 2, cluster of differentiation 13-alanyl aminopeptidase, and antigen Kiel 67. Microvessels were isolated for gene expression profiling and in vitro pericyte expansion. Immunofluorescence validated the cell culture model. Plasma-derived extracellular vesicles from hypertensive rodents were applied as a treatment to assess their effects on pericyte function and detailed metabolic assessments on enriched pericytes measured oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Our results reveal a shift in platelet-derived growth factor receptor β Our findings demonstrate that cerebral pericytes undergo phenotypic and metabolic reprogramming in response to hypertension, with hypertensive-derived plasma-derived extracellular vesicles impairing their mitochondrial function. Importantly, plasma-derived extracellular vesicles from normotensive controls restore this function, suggesting their potential as both therapeutic agents and precision biomarkers for hypertensive vascular complications. Further investigation into plasma-derived extracellular vesicle cargo is essential to further explore their therapeutic potential in vascular health."

37200023,Integrin/Src,neurodegeneration,Giant worm-shaped ESCRT scaffolds surround actin-independent integrin clusters.,4,include_primary_high,"Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins can be transiently recruited to the plasma membrane for membrane repair and formation of extracellular vesicles. Here, we discovered micrometer-sized worm-shaped ESCRT structures that stably persist for multiple hours at the plasma membrane of macrophages, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts. These structures surround clusters of integrins and known cargoes of extracellular vesicles. The ESCRT structures are tightly connected to the cellular support and are left behind by the cells together with surrounding patches of membrane. The phospholipid composition is altered at the position of the ESCRT structures, and the actin cytoskeleton is locally degraded, which are hallmarks of membrane damage and extracellular vesicle formation. Disruption of actin polymerization increased the formation of the ESCRT structures and cell adhesion. The ESCRT structures were also present at plasma membrane contact sites with membrane-disrupting silica crystals. We propose that the ESCRT proteins are recruited to adhesion-induced membrane tears to induce extracellular shedding of the damaged membrane."

However, safe and efficient delivery of miR-210 via intravenous administration is still a challenge. In the past decade, exosomes have emerged as a novel endogenous delivery system. Here, c(RGDyK) peptide is conjugated to exosomes, and they are loaded with cholesterol-modified miR-210 (RGD-exo:miR-210). In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model, the RGD-exo:miR-210 targets the lesion region of the ischemic brain after intravenous administration, resulting in an increase in miR-210 at the site. Furthermore, RGD-exo:miR-210 are administered once every other day for 14 days, and the expressions of integrin β These results suggest a strategy for the targeted delivery of miR-210 to ischemic brain and provide an angiogenic agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke."
29965997,Integrin/Src,neurodegeneration,Complex polymorphisms in endocytosis genes suggest alpha-cyclodextrin as a treatment for breast cancer.,4,include_primary_high,"Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance. Results from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Health's ""Up For A Challenge"" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of β1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells). Beta-cyclodextrins (βCD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller alpha-cyclodextrins (αCD) also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-αCD to be twice as effective as HPβCD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. If the previous successful animal studies with βCDs are replicated with the safer and more effective αCDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with αCDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPαCD, but women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively."
34428952,TGF-beta,neurodegeneration,Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Ameliorate Dermal Fibrosis in a Murine Model of Bleomycin-Induced Scleroderma.,4,include_primary_high,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become a promising therapeutic strategy for scleroderma. Exosomes derived from MSCs (MSC-exosomes) possess functional properties similar to those of their source cells. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential role of MSC-exosomes in the treatment of scleroderma. MSC-exosomes were isolated from human umbilical cords through ultracentrifugation and characterized. An experimental fibrosis model was established in BALB/c mice by a subcutaneous injection of bleomycin, followed by treatment with MSC-exosomes or MSC infusions once a week for a total of four doses. Using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry, hydroxyproline content, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses, we investigated the effects of MSC-exosomes on dermal fibrosis and explored the underlying mechanism. MSC-exosome treatment restored the dermal architecture, reduced dermal thickness, and partially increased subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. In addition, MSC-exosomes inhibited the expression of collagen (COL)-I, COL-III, and α-smooth muscle actin. The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad signaling pathway was also suppressed in MSC-exosome-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest that MSC-exosomes can attenuate myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition in dermal fibrosis by downregulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, the use of MSC-exosomes may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of scleroderma."
40832971,TGF-beta,neurodegeneration,Exercise-induced extracellular vesicles derived from platelet-rich plasma improved recovery after ischemic stroke.,4,include_primary_high,"Stroke remains a major global health burden, with limited treatments for chronic ischemic stroke necessitating novel therapies. This study explored the therapeutic potential of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in stroke recovery, particularly in exercise-trained rats. PRP-derived EVs from treadmill-loaded and sedentary rats were designated athletes (aPRP-EVs) and non-athlete (nPRP-EVs), respectively. Both were administered to primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and to adult male Wistar/ST rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Exercise increased CD63, CD31, and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in PRP-derived EVs. In OGD-exposed neurons, aPRP-EVs enhanced viability, elevated phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, and reduced intracellular calcium. Canonical pathway analysis showed upregulated TGF-β/SMAD signaling in EV groups versus vehicle, while 'Ca signaling' was downregulated in aPRP-EVs versus nPRP-EVs. In MCAO rats, EVs improved neurological and motor function and reduced neuronal apoptosis at 28 days, with aPRP-EVs promoting earlier, greater recovery and infarct reduction. These effects correlated with TGF-β1 upregulation, SMAD4 nuclear translocation, reduced NMDAR2B expression, and enhanced axonal growth in the peri-infarct region. PRP-derived EVs, particularly from exercise-trained donors, enhance neuroregeneration and functional recovery in chronic ischemic stroke via TGF-β/SMAD and calcium signaling modulation."

This review synthesizes current evidence on the phase-specific evaluation of sciatic nerve regeneration in preclinical models, integrating behavioral, sensory, electrophysiological, and morphological approaches across the acute, subacute (Wallerian degeneration), early regenerative, and late regenerative phases. By mapping functional readouts onto the underlying biological events of each phase, we highlight how tools such as the Sciatic Functional Index, Beam Walk test, Rotarod test, nerve conduction studies, and nociceptive assays provide complementary and often non-interchangeable information about motor, sensory, and neuromuscular recovery. We further examine emerging therapeutic strategies, including intraoperative electrical stimulation, immunomodulation, platelet-rich plasma, bioengineered scaffolds, conductive and piezoelectric conduits, exosome-based hydrogels, tacrolimus delivery systems, and small molecules, emphasizing the importance of aligning their mechanisms of action with the dynamic microenvironment of peripheral nerve repair. Despite substantial advancements in experimental models, an analysis of publication trends and registries reveals a persistent translational gap, with remarkably few clinical trials relative to the high volume of preclinical studies. To illustrate how mechanistic insights can be complemented by molecular-level characterization, we also present a targeted computational analysis of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA,) including frontier orbital energies, physicochemical descriptors, and docking interactions with IL-6, TGF-β, and a growth-factor receptor-performed solely for this molecule due to its documented structural availability and relevance. By presenting an integrated, phase-specific framework for functional assessment and therapeutic evaluation, this review underscores the need for standardized, biologically aligned methodologies to improve the rigor, comparability, and clinical relevance of future studies in sciatic nerve regeneration."
