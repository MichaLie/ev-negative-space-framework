Exosomes, as a new therapeutic method, play a protective role in neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and traumatic brain injury in recent years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of exosomes in glutamate (Glu)-induced neuronal injury, and to explore its mechanism, providing new ideas for the treatment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. The neuron damage model induced by Glu was established, and its metabolomics was analyzed and identified. BV2 cells were induced to differentiate into M1 and M2 subtypes. After the exosomes from both M1-BV2 cells and M2-BV2 cells were collected, exosome morphological identification was performed by transmission electron microscopy and exosome-specific markers were also detected. These exosomes were then cocultured with HT22 cells. CCK-8 method and LDH kit were used to detect cell viability and toxicity. Cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS content were respectively detected by flow cytometry, JC-1 assay and DCFH-DA assay. MiR-124-3p expression level was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay predicted and verified the relationship between miR-124-3p and ROCK1 or ROCK2. Through metabolomics, 81 different metabolites were found, including fructose, GABA, 2, 4-diaminobutyric acid, etc. The enrichment analysis of differential metabolites showed that they were mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, and urea cycle. M2 microglia-derived exosomes could reduce the apoptosis, decrease the accumulation of ROS, restore the mitochondrial membrane potential and the anti-oxidative stress ability in HT22 cells induced by Glu. It was also found that the protective effect of miR-124-3p mimic on neurons was comparable to that of M2-EXOs. Additionally, M2-EXOs might carry miR-124-3p to target ROCK1 and ROCK2 in neurons, affecting ROCK/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and then reducing Glu-induced neuronal apoptosis. M2 microglia-derived exosomes may protect HT22 cells against Glu-induced injury by transferring miR-124-3p into HT22 cells, with ROCK being a target gene for miR-124-3p."

A theoretical protein-RNA recognition code that assumes that the second letter in codons is compatible with specific amino acids involved in protein-RNA recognition was used to search for compatibility of human α-synuclein (α-syn) with mRNAs in the human transcriptome (1-L transcription). The 1-L transcription revealed compatible amino acid sequences with the ATTTA ARE (class I), PAS and polyA in α-syn, supporting a protein-RNA regulatory model. In PD, inflammatory microglia reactions, cognitive decline and motor circuit disturbances are observed. The model theoretically explains why α-syn producing neurons are less protected from inflammation and why microglia are activated. Consistent with knowledge of PD, the identified genes showed how the PI3K-AKT pathway is downregulated, how reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and sensitivity are increased, how mitochondria are destabilized, why autophagy is impaired, and why neuronal depigmentation is observed. 1-L transcription of α-syn leads to genes/proteins relevant to PD. When α-syn is accepted as a small RNA recognition protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulations, some identified genes indicate that its function is an important regulatory factor associated with intracellular and extracellular transport of RNA vesicles. These vesicles are extremely important in cellular communication. In addition, the spectrum of identified genes strongly indicates that α-syn produced by neuronal cells is required for proper regulation of inflammatory and immune responses."

The recent work has highlighted the utility of a neuron-specific Arf1-knockout mouse model and corresponding cells for elucidating the nexus between lipid metabolism disorders and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, it is found that Arf1 deficiency first induced surplus fatty acid synthesis through the AKT-mTORC1-SREBP1-FASN axis, which further triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial stress cascade via calcium flux. The organelle stress cascade further caused mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to be released into cytoplasm. Concurrently, the FASN-driven fatty acid synthesis in the Arf1-deficient neurons might also induce accumulation of sphingolipids in lysosomes that caused dysfunction of autophagy and lysosomes, which further promoted lysosomal stress and mitochondria-derived extracellular vesicles (MDEVs) release. The released MDEVs carried mtDNA into microglia to activate the inflammatory pathways and neurodegeneration. The studies on neuronal lipid droplets (LDs) and recent studies of microglial LDs suggest a unified pathological function of LDs in NDs: activating the inflammatory pathways in microglia. This finding potentially provides new therapeutic strategies for NDs."

Neuron-derived exosomes/extracellular vesicles (EVs) (NDEs) and stem cell-derived exosomes/EVs exhibit neuroprotective effects by promoting Aβ degradation, modulating tau pathology, and reducing inflammation. Notably, NDEs carry insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and cellular prion proteins (PrPC), aiding Aβ clearance.

Neural and mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes further demonstrate therapeutic efficacy by altering amyloid precursor protein processing and activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling to reduce AD pathology. Despite these advancements, clinical translation requires a deeper understanding of exosome/EVs biology, improved isolation techniques, and personalized strategies.

Next, exosomes containing functional NADPH oxidase 2 complexes are released from macrophages and incorporated into injured axons via endocytosis. Once in axonal endosomes, active NOX2 is retrogradely transported to the cell body through an importin-β1-dynein-dependent mechanism. Endosomal NOX2 oxidizes PTEN, which leads to its inactivation, thus stimulating PI3K-phosporylated (p-)Akt signalling and regenerative outgrowth. Challenging the view that ROS are exclusively involved in nerve degeneration, we propose a previously unrecognized role of ROS in mammalian axonal regeneration through a NOX2-PI3K-p-Akt signalling pathway."

Metabolic alterations observed in the course of neurodegeneration favor ceramide-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling, while the levels of the neuroprotective S1P are reduced. These trends are observed early in the diseases' development, suggesting causal relationship. Mechanistic evidence has shown links between altered ceramide/S1P rheostat and the production, secretion, and aggregation of amyloid β/α-synuclein as well as signaling pathways of critical importance for the pathomechanism of protein conformation diseases. Sphingolipids influence multiple aspects of Akt/protein kinase B signaling, a pathway that regulates metabolism, stress response, and Bcl-2 family proteins. The cross-talk between sphingolipids and transcription factors including NF-κB, FOXOs, and AP-1 may be also important for immune regulation and cell survival/death. Sphingolipids regulate exosomes and other secretion mechanisms that can contribute to either the spread of neurotoxic proteins between brain cells, or their clearance. Recent discoveries also suggest the importance of intracellular and exosomal pools of small regulatory RNAs in the creation of disturbed signaling environment in the diseased brain. The identified interactions of bioactive sphingolipids urge for their evaluation as potential therapeutic targets.

Exosomes are nanoscale membrane-bound carriers that can be secreted by cells and carry several cargoes, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites. Exosomes significantly take part in the intercellular communications due to their specific features including low immunogenicity, flexibility, and great tissue/cell penetration capabilities. Due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, these nano-sized structures have been introduced as proper vehicles for central nervous system drug delivery by multiple studies.

Exosomal miRNAs have not yet been described as a tool for bulbar-onset ALS diagnosis or prognosis prediction. In this study, candidate exosomal miRNAs were identified by small RNA sequencing using samples from patients with bulbar-onset ALS and healthy controls. Potential pathogenic mechanisms were identified through enrichment analysis of target genes for differential miRNAs. Expression of miR-16-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-22-3p, and miR-93-5p was significantly up-regulated in plasma exosomes from bulbar-onset ALS patients compared with healthy control subjects. Among them, miR-16-5p and miR-23a-3p were significantly lower in spinal-onset ALS patients than those with bulbar-onset. Furthermore, up-regulation of miR-23a-3p in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell viability. This miRNA was found to directly target ERBB4 and regulate the AKT/GSK3β pathway. Collectively, the above miRNAs and their targets are related to the development of bulbar-onset ALS.

Transcriptome sequencing of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) revealed high expression of the long noncoding RNA ENST00000629969 (hereinafter referred to as lncRNA-9969). We isolated exosomes from hUC-MSCs (WT-Exo) and established human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells stably knocked down for lncRNA-9969 via siRNA, from which corresponding exosomes (KD-Exo) were isolated. Cross-species analysis identified the mouse homolog of lncRNA-9969 as ENSMUST00000200021 (hereinafter referred to as lncRNA-0021). Cellular experiments employed an Aβ₂₅₋₃₅-induced SH-SY5Y cell model to evaluate the protective effects of exosomes. In animal experiments, 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice received biweekly tail vein injections of WT-Exo or KD-Exo for 4 weeks. Phenotypic and mechanistic analyses were subsequently conducted using the Morris water maze, Western blot, immunofluorescence, qPCR, and transmission electron microscopy. In Aβ-injured SH-SY5Y cells, WT-Exo significantly attenuated cellular damage and promoted Aβ clearance, whereas the protective effect of KD-Exo was markedly reduced. In APP/PS1 mice, WT-Exo treatment significantly improved spatial memory deficits and upregulated hippocampal expression of synaptic proteins synaptophysin (Syn) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Molecular mechanism studies demonstrated that lncRNA-0021 directly binds mmu-miR-6361. Through this ceRNA mechanism, exosome-delivered lncRNA activated the mTOR/p70S6K autophagy pathway, regulated lipid metabolism-related genes, promoted microglial polarization toward the protective M2 phenotype, and suppressed pyroptosis. These beneficial changes were not observed in the KD-Exo-treated group. hUC-MSC-derived exosomes exert neuroprotective effects by delivering functional lncRNA-9969. Its highly conserved homolog in mice, lncRNA-0021, achieves coordinated multi-target regulation of neuroinflammation, pyroptosis, and metabolic disturbances by sequestering miR-6361 and activating downstream signaling pathways.

The canonical view is that defects in these processes lead to impaired lysosomal clearance of proteins prone to form toxic oligomeric assemblies and/or aggregates, ultimately resulting in cellular pathologies that define these disorders. Because lysosomes mediate the clearance of a large number of lipids, lipid storage is frequently associated with compromised endolysosomal and autophagic function.

Interferon gamma-stimulated exosomes (IFNγ-Exos) secreted from MSCs were isolated, purified, and injected into the vitreous body of RCS rats on postnatal day (P) 21. Morphological and functional changes in the retina were examined at P28, P35, P42, and P49 in Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats. The mechanism was explored using high-throughput sequencing technology and confirmed in vitro. Treatment with IFNγ-Exo produced better protective effects on photoreceptors and improved visual function in RCS rats. IFNγ-Exo significantly suppressed the activated microglia and inhibited the inflammatory responses in the retina of RCS rats, which was also confirmed in the lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia cell line BV2.

In vivo and in vitro studies showed that sirtuin3 knockdown diminished the ability of PACAP to restore normal autophagy function, resulting in phagocytosis dysregulation and the accumulation of pTau, Tau, and Aβ. Additionally, the autophagic biomarker MAP1LC3 demonstrated a positive association with PACAP in human serum. PACAP reverses AD-induced cognitive impairment through autophagy, using sirtuin3 as a key mediator. MAP1LC3 has a positive relationship with PACAP in humans. These findings provide insights regarding potential uses of intranasal PACAP and sirtuin3 agonists in AD treatment. NCT04320368."

Data from both in vitro and in vivo AD models have implied that an aberrant increase of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling may be a causative factor for the formation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. In the present study, we showed that in post-mortem human AD brain, tau was localized within different organelles (autophagic vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, and mitochondria). In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably carrying different genetic variants of mTor, we found a common link between the synthesis and distribution of intracellular tau. mTor overexpression or the lack of its expression was responsible for the altered balance of phosphorylated (p-)/-non phosphorylated (Np-) tau in the cytoplasm and different cellular compartments, which might facilitate tau deposition. Up-regulated mTor activity resulted in a significant increase in the amount of cytosolic tau as well as its re-localization to exocytotic vesicles that were not associated with exosomes. These results have implicated that mTor is involved in regulating tau distribution in subcellular organelles and in the initiation of tau secretion from cells to extracellular space."

Hence, we overexpressed or silenced RTP801 protein in cultured cortical neurons, isolated their derived EVs (RTP801-EVs or shRTP801-EVs, respectively), and characterized EVs protein content by mass spectrometry (MS). RTP801-EVs toxicity was assessed by treating cultured neurons with these EVs and quantifying apoptotic neuron death and branching. We also tested shRTP801-EVs functionality in the pathologic in vitro model of 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Expression of RTP801 increased the number of EVs released by neurons. Moreover, RTP801 led to a distinct proteomic signature of neuron-derived EVs, containing more pro-apoptotic markers. Hence, we observed that RTP801-induced toxicity was transferred to neurons via EVs, activating apoptosis and impairing neuron morphology complexity. In contrast, shRTP801-EVs were able to increase the arborization in recipient neurons. The 6-OHDA neurotoxin elevated levels of RTP801 in EVs, and 6-OHDA-derived EVs lost the mTOR/Akt signalling activation via Akt and RPS6 downstream effectors. Interestingly, EVs derived from neurons where RTP801 was silenced prior to exposing them to 6-OHDA maintained Akt and RPS6 transactivation in recipient neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that RTP801-induced toxicity is transferred via EVs, and therefore, it could contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, in which RTP801 is involved."

Since miR-210 is known to protect cerebral endothelial cell mitochondria by reducing oxidative stress, here we study the effects of miR-210-loaded EPC-EXs (miR210-EPC-EXs) on ischemic brain damage in acute ischemic stroke (IS). The miR210-EPC-EXs were generated from EPCs transfected with miR-210 mimic. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed to induce acute IS in C57BL/6 mice. EPC-EXs or miR210-EPC-EXs were administrated via tail vein injection 2 hrs after IS. To explore the potential mechanisms, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)/PI3 kinase (PI3K) or tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB)/PI3k pathways were used. The brain tissue was collected after treatments for infarct size, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and protein expression (VEGFR2, TrkB) analyses on day two. The neurological deficit score (NDS) was evaluated before collecting the samples. 1) As compared to EPC-EXs, miR210-EPC-EXs profoundly reduced the infarct volume and improved the NDS on day two post-IS. 2) Fewer apoptosis cells were detected in the peri-infarct brain of mice treated with miR210-EPC-EXs than in EPC-EXs-treated mice. Meanwhile, the oxidative stress was profoundly reduced by miR210-EPC-EXs. 3) The ratios of p-PI3k/PI3k, p- VEGFR2/VEGFR2, and p-TrkB/TrkB in the ipsilateral brain were raised by miR210-EPC-EXs treatment. These effects could be significantly blocked or partially inhibited by PI3k, VEGFR2, or TrkB pathway inhibitors.

This review intends to synthesize emerging frameworks that reposition neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as progressive breakdowns of interpretive cellular logic, rather than mere terminal consequences of protein aggregation or synaptic attrition. The discussion aims to provide a detailed mapping of how critical signaling pathways-including PI3K-AKT-mTOR, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and integrated stress response cascades-undergo spatial and temporal disintegration. Special attention is directed toward the roles of RNA-binding proteins (e.g., TDP-43, FUS, ELAVL2), m6A epitranscriptomic modifiers (METTL3, YTHDF1, IGF2BP1), and non-canonical post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, crotonylation) in disrupting translation fidelity, proteostasis, and subcellular targeting. At the organelle level, the review seeks to highlight how the failure of ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), autophagosome-lysosome fusion machinery (STX17, SNAP29), and mitochondrial import/export systems (TIM/TOM complexes) generates cumulative stress and impairs neuronal triage. These dysfunctions are compounded by mitochondrial protease overload (LONP1, CLPP), UPR maladaptation, and phase-transitioned stress granules that sequester nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins and ribosomal subunits, especially in ALS and FTD contexts. Synaptic disassembly is treated not only as a downstream event, but as an early tipping point, driven by impaired PSD scaffolding, aberrant endosomal recycling (Rab5, Rab11), complement-mediated pruning (C1q/C3-CR3 axis), and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance linked to parvalbumin interneuron decay. Using insights from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, the review illustrates how regional vulnerability to proteostatic and metabolic stress converges with signaling noise to produce entropic attractor collapse within core networks such as the DMN, SN, and FPCN. By framing neurodegeneration as an active loss of cellular and network ""meaning-making""-a collapse of coordinated signal interpretation, triage prioritization, and adaptive response-the review aims to support a more integrative conceptual model. In this context, therapeutic direction may shift from damage containment toward restoring high-dimensional neuronal agency, via strategies that include the following elements: reprogrammable proteome-targeting agents (e.g., PROTACs), engineered autophagy adaptors, CRISPR-based BDNF enhancers, mitochondrial gatekeeping stabilizers, and glial-exosome neuroengineering. This synthesis intends to offer a translational scaffold for viewing neurodegeneration as not only a disorder of accumulation but as a systems-level failure of cellular reasoning-a perspective that may inform future efforts in resilience-based intervention and precision neurorestoration."

Exosome release was significantly reduced by Aβ1-42 treatment in cultured astrocytes accompanied by an increased JNK phosphorylation. Whereas, apoE-HDL release remained unchanged. A JNK inhibitor restored the decreased levels of exosome release induced by Aβ treatment to levels similar to those of control, suggesting that Aβ1-42 inhibits exosome release via stimulation of JNK signal pathway.

Transmission electron microscopy and differential ultracentrifugation were used to verify the existence of exosomes. In vivo and in vitro assays were used to identify roles of exosomal miR-934. RNA pull-down assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay, etc. were applied to clarify the mechanism of exosomal miR-934 regulated the crosstalk between CRC cells and M2 macrophages. In the present study, we first demonstrated the aberrant overexpression of miR-934 in colorectal cancer (CRC), especially in CRLM, and its correlation with the poor prognosis of CRC patients. Then, we verified that CRC cell-derived exosomal miR-934 induced M2 macrophage polarization by downregulating PTEN expression and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, we revealed that hnRNPA2B1 mediated miR-934 packaging into exosomes of CRC cells and then transferred exosomal miR-934 into macrophages. Interestingly, polarized M2 macrophages could induce premetastatic niche formation and promote CRLM by secreting CXCL13, which activated a CXCL13/CXCR5/NFκB/p65/miR-934 positive feedback loop in CRC cells. These findings indicate that tumor-derived exosomal miR-934 can promote CRLM by regulating the crosstalk between CRC cells and TAMs. These findings reveal a tumor and TAM interaction in the metastatic microenvironment mediated by tumor-derived exosomes that affects CRLM. The present study also provides a theoretical basis for secondary liver cancer."

Transwell assays and an ectopic liver metastasis model were established to evaluate the metastatic ability of tumour cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were applied to identify the differentially expressed genes and proteins in CRC cells and in TAM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs).

EMT can be initiated and promoted by deregulated oncogenic signaling pathways, hypoxia, and cells in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a loss-of-epithelial cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion, and enhanced invasive/migratory properties. Numerous transcriptional regulators, such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB1/ZEB2 induce EMT through the downregulation of epithelial markers and gain-of-expression of the mesenchymal markers. Additionally, signaling cascades such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, Sonic hedgehog, nuclear factor kappa B, receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Hippo, and transforming growth factor-β pathways regulate EMT whereas they are often deregulated in cancers leading to aberrant EMT. Furthermore, noncoding RNAs, tumor-derived exosomes, and epigenetic alterations are also involved in the modulation of EMT. Therefore, the regulation of EMT is a vital strategy to control the aggressive metastatic characteristics of tumor cells. Despite the vast amount of preclinical data on EMT in cancer progression, there is a lack of clinical translation at the therapeutic level.

Finally, the expression levels of miR-188-3p in exosomes from CRC patient plasma were determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and the relationship between the expression of miR-188-3p in plasma exosomes and CRC prognosis was analyzed. The expression level of miR-188-3p within plasma exosomes demonstrated a statistically significant increase in CRC with liver metastasis compared to those without liver metastases.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was employed to determine the expression levels of AGD1 and METTL13 mRNAs in PCSCs and exosomes. Protein expression levels were examined using western blots and dot blots. The potential functions of AGD1 and METTL13 in CRPC were investigated through cell proliferation assay, Transwell assay, EdU incorporation assays, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and sphere formation assays. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of AGD1, RNA pull-down assay, RIP, co-Immunoprecipitation (co-IP), mass spectrometry (MS), Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and single-base elongation and ligation-based qPCR amplification method (SELECT) were performed. The effects of AGD1 and METTL13 on CRPC development and metastasis under docetaxel treatment were analyzed using a xenograft mouse model and an organoid model. Additionally, liposomal-chitosan nanocomplex drug delivery systems were designed to explore AGD1's role in regulating docetaxel treatment resistance in CRPC. AGD1 expression was upregulated in PCSCs and exosomes. Downregulating AGD1 enhanced the sensitivity of CRPC to docetaxel treatment by inhibiting their stemness, with the reverse also being true. RNA pull-down, combined with MS, co-IP and RIP assays, demonstrated that AGD1 binds to METTL13 and USP10, forming a complex that facilitates METTL13 protein accumulation through USP10-induced deubiquitination. MeRIP assay and SELECT assay revealed that METTL13 transcriptionally controls the mRNA decay of CD44 via m6A methylation. Additionally, this process activates the pSTAT3/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Organoid models and liposomal-chitosan nanocomplex drug delivery systems showed that reducing AGD1 expression enhanced the therapeutic effect of docetaxel in CRPC. AGD1 mediates the stemness and apoptosis of PCSCs and promotes docetaxel treatment resistance by enhancing tumor growth and metastasis through USP10/METTL13-mediated CD44 mRNA decay in CRPC."

Here, we reveal a new mode of intercellular communication by melanosomes, large EVs secreted by melanocytes for melanin transport. Unlike small EVs, which are disintegrated within the receiver cell, melanosomes stay intact within them, gain a unique protein signature, and can then be further transferred to another cell as ""second-hand"" EVs. We show that melanoma-secreted melanosomes passaged through epidermal keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts can be further engulfed by resident macrophages. This process leads to macrophage polarization into pro-tumor or pro-immune cell infiltration phenotypes. Melanosomes that are transferred through fibroblasts can carry AKT1, which induces VEGF secretion from macrophages in an mTOR-dependent manner, promoting angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo. In melanoma patients, macrophages that are co-localized with AKT1 are correlated with disease aggressiveness, and immunotherapy non-responders are enriched in macrophages containing melanosome markers. Our findings suggest that interactions mediated by second-hand extracellular vesicles contribute to the formation of the metastatic niche, and that blocking the melanosome cues of macrophage diversification could be helpful in halting melanoma progression."

Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, are the three basic standard modes of cancer treatment. However, difficulties in cancer treatment are increasing due to immune escape, spreading of cancer to other places, and resistance of cancer cells to therapies. Various signaling mechanisms, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, RAS, WNT/β-catenin, TGF-beta, and notch pathways, are involved in cancer resistance. The adaptive inflammatory response is the initial line of defence against infection. However, chronic inflammation can lead to tumorigenesis, malignant transformation, tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. The most commonly dysregulated inflammatory pathways linked to cancer include NF-κB, MAPK, JAK-STAT, and PI3K/AKT. To overcome major hurdles in cancer therapy, nanomedicine is receiving much attention due to its role as a vehicle for delivering chemotherapeutic agents that specifically target tumor sites. Several biocompatible nanocarriers including polymer and inorganic nanoparticles, liposomes, micellar nanoparticles, nanotubes, and exosomes have been extensively studied. Exosome has been reported as an important potential system that could be effectively used as a bioinspired, bioengineered, and biomimetic drug delivery solution considering its toxicity, immunogenicity, and rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system. Exosome-mimetic vesicles are receiving much interest for developing nano-sized delivery systems. In this review, exosomes in detail as well as certain other nanocarriers, and their potential therapeutic roles in cancer therapy has been thoroughly discussed. Additionally, we also reviewed on oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins, inflammation, and their associated signaling pathways and their interference by exosomes based nanomedicine."

ABHD12 expression was high in lung metastatic tumors and was mostly expressed by macrophages. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-derived sEVs carrying ABHD12-polarized macrophages toward an immunosuppressive phenotype, driving premetastatic niche formation, which facilitated lung metastasis. ABHD12 additionally upregulated S1PR1 by activating the AKT-FoxO1 pathway in macrophages, and significantly enhanced antitumor responses were observed in tumor models treated with agents targeting both S1PR1 and PD-1.

To show the therapeutic effects of the human bone marrow MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) on colorectal cancer (CRC) and explore the molecular cross-talks between them, CRC cells were treated with the MSC-Exos. We found that MSC-Exos were enriched with miR-100 and miR-143, which effectively downregulated mTOR, Cyclin D1, K-RAS, HK2 while upregulated p-27 expression. All these effects were reversed by concurrent treatment with MSC-Exos and antagomiR-100, confirming that they were caused by exosomal transfer of miR-100 into recipient CRC cells. Moreover, exosomal miR-100 promoted endogenous miR-143 expression. The flow cytometry, MTT and trypan blue assays revealed that MSC-Exos could efficiently suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of the CRC cells. Furthermore, wound healing, transwell migration and invasion assays confirmed their inhibitory effects on the migration and invasiveness of SW480 cells. We further confirmed these effects by analyzing the expression levels of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors and metastasis-related genes. Results showed that MSC-Exos significantly suppressed the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 (metastasis-related genes), SNAIL and TWIST (EMT-inducing transcription factors), Vimentin and N-cadherin (mesenchymal cell markers), whereas E-cadherin (epithelial cell marker) was remarkably up-regulated. Collectively, our data indicated that MSC-Exos could suppress proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis while inducing the apoptosis of the CRC cells via miR-100/mTOR/miR-143 axis. Our findings highlight that MSC-Exo treatment as well as miR-100 restoration might be considered as potential therapeutic strategies for CRC."

This subtype, devoid of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, largely relies on breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) for its progression, metastasis, and recurrence. BCSCs, characterized by their self-renewal capacity and resistance to conventional therapies, exploit key surface markers and critical signaling pathways like Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, TGF-β, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hippo-YAP/TAZ to thrive. Their adaptability is underscored by mechanisms including drug efflux and enhanced DNA repair, contributing to poor prognosis and high recurrence rates. The tumor microenvironment (TME) further facilitates BCSC survival through complex interactions with stromal and immune cells. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting BCSCs - ranging from immunotherapy and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to gene-editing technologies - aim to disrupt these resistant cells. Additionally, innovative approaches focusing on exosome-mediated signaling and metabolic reprogramming show promise in overcoming chemoresistance. By elucidating the distinct characteristics of BCSCs and their role in TNBC, researchers are paving the way for novel treatments that may effectively eradicate these resilient cells, mitigate metastasis, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This review highlights the urgent need for targeted strategies that address the unique biology of BCSCs in the pursuit of more effective therapeutic interventions for TNBC."

This study aims to elucidate how hypoxia-resistant gastric cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles affect the peritoneal metastasis of normoxic gastric cancer cells. Proteomic analysis revealed elevated levels of Caveolin1 and Laminin β2 in hypoxia-resistant gastric cancer cells and their corresponding extracellular vesicles. Importantly, Caveolin1 was found to play a central role in mediating Laminin β2 sorting into extracellular vesicles derived from hypoxia-resistant gastric cancer cells, and subsequently, extracellular vesicle-associated Laminin β2 promoted peritoneal metastasis in normoxic gastric cancer cells by activating the AKT pathway. Further investigation confirmed that Caveolin1 activation by Rho-related Coiled-coil kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation of Y14 residue is a key factor facilitating Laminin β2 sorting into extracellular vesicles. Moreover, Y14 phosphorylated- Caveolin1 enhanced Laminin β2 sorting by activating Rab11.

At a cell-type level, some miRNAs mainly influence cancer cell-intrinsic processes and pathways, whereas other miRNAs predominantly act in distinct cellular compartments of the TME to regulate fibroblast and immune cell functions and/or influence other cell types' function via cell-to-cell communications by transfer of extracellular vesicles. At a molecular level, the influence of miRNA-mediated regulation often converges in core signaling pathways, including TGF-β, JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB."

Studies have shown that SYT7 is an important regulatory molecule of exocytosis in various cells. However, the characteristics of SYT7 across cancers and the function of SYT7 in tumor exosome secretion remain unclear. In this study, we conducted systematic pancancer analyses of SYT7, namely, analyses of expression patterns, diagnostic and prognostic values, genetic alterations, methylation, immune infiltration, and potential biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SYT7 increased the secretion of exosomes from A549 and H1299 cells, promoting the migration, proliferation, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Notably, SYT7 promoted angiogenesis by transferring exosomes containing the molecule centrosomal protein of 55 kDa (CEP55) protein to HUVECs. The CEP55 protein levels was downregulated in STAT1 inhibitor-treating SYT7-overexpresion NSCLC cells. We further found that SYT7 activated the mTOR signaling pathway through the downstream molecule CEP55, thereby promoting the invasion and metastasis of NSCLC cells. SYT7 promoted exosome secretion by NSCLC cells through upregulating syntaxin-1a and syntaxin-3. In vivo, SYT7 promoted the tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis of A549 cells through the exosome pathway. Our study is of great importance for understanding the mechanism of tumor exosome secretion and the role of exosomes in tumor progression."

However, the mechanisms underlying B7-H3-promoted angiogenesis are still largely unknown. In this study, based on the observation of overexpression of B7-H3 on the tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, we investigated the roles of cancer cell-drived exosomal B7-H3 in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis through crosstalk between cancer cells and VECs. We found that CRC cell-drived exosomal B7-H3 was uptaken by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and consequently activated the AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) / mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) / vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) signaling pathway, thus augmenting the abilities of migration, invasion and tube formation of HUVECs. Furthermore, administration of CRC cell-drived exosomes with reinforced B7-H3 promoted the pulmonary angiogenesis and metastasis of CRC cells in mice. In addition, high expression of B7-H3 was observed in urinary exosomes isolated from CRC patients. Our findings reveal that CRC-derived exosomal B7-H3 promotes tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by activating the AKT1/mTOR/VEGFA signaling pathway. It provides novel insights into the roles of CRC-drived exosomes in CRC progression."

A number of studies in metastatic breast cancer have shown the potential of ctDNA to predict prognosis and treatment response using ctDNA. Further developments have included deeper sequencing using whole exome and shallow whole genome approaches which has the potential to identify new mutations and chromosomal copy number changes which appear upon resistance to treatment. In early breast cancer, recent work utilising personalised digital PCR probes has shown huge potential in predicting disease relapse and the detection of micrometastatic disease which could lead to improved treatment and outcome for these patients. Specific pathways of resistance can also be monitored and liquid biopsy approaches for the detection of ESR1 mutations have been used which could identify patients who have become resistant to particular endocrine therapies. The identification of PIK3CA mutations in plasma has also been shown to predict a higher response rate to specific PI3K inhibitors and could be used as a non-invasive screening tool prior to treatment. Further work on the detection of exosomal miRNA and hypermethylated DNA in plasma have shown promise in terms of specificity for early breast cancer detection and could be used to monitor treatment response.

However, the mechanism of hypoxia-activated tumor-stroma crosstalk in HNSCC metastasis remains to be deciphered. Here, we demonstrated that HIF1α was upregulated in HNSCC specimens compared with adjacent normal tissues, whose overexpression was associated with lymph node metastasis and predicted unfavorable prognosis. HIF1α expression correlated positively with the levels of miR-5100 as well as α-SMA, the marker of CAFs. Hypoxia/HIF1α regulated transcriptionally miR-5100 to promote the degradation of its target gene QKI, which acts as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC. Hypoxic HNSCC-derived exosomal miR-5100 promoted the activation of CAFs by orchestrating QKI/AKT/STAT3 axis, which further facilitated HNSCC metastasis. Additionally, miR-5100 derived from plasma exosomes indicated HNSCC malignant progression. In conclusion, our findings illuminate a novel HIF1α/miR-5100/QKI pathway in HNSCC metastasis, and suggest that miR-5100 might be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for HNSCC."

Herein, we aimed to understand the role (on a molecular basis) patient-derived EVs play in modulating cancer stemness and tumorigenesis in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). EVs from patient sera were isolated, quantified and characterized. The EVs were vigorously tested, both in vitro and in vivo, through various functional assays. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify the functional components of EVs. The presence and level of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) in circulating EVs and tumor and non-tumorous tissues of patients with HCC were determined by ELISA, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. The functional role and underlying mechanism of EVs with enhanced pIgR expression were elucidated. Blockade of EV-pIgR with neutralizing antibody was performed in nude mice implanted with patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs). Circulating EVs from patients with late-stage HCC (L-HCC) had significantly elevated pIgR expression compared to the EVs released by control individuals. The augmenting effect of L-HCC-EVs on cancer stemness and tumorigenesis was hindered by an anti-pIgR antibody. EVs enriched with pIgR consistently promoted cancer stemness and cancerous phenotypes in recipient cells. Mechanistically, EV-pIgR-induced cancer aggressiveness was abrogated by Akt and β-catenin inhibitors, confirming that the role of EV-pIgR depends on the activation of the PDK1/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling axis. Furthermore, an anti-pIgR neutralizing antibody attenuated tumor growth in mice implanted with PDTXs. This study illustrates a previously unknown role of EV-pIgR in regulating cancer stemness and aggressiveness: EV-pIgR activates PDK1/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling cascades. The blockade of the intercellular communication mediated by EV-pIgR in the tumor microenvironment may provide a new therapeutic strategy for patients with cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1 million patients will die from liver cancer, mostly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in 2030. Understanding the underlying mechanism by which HCC acquires aggressive attributes is crucial to improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Herein, we demonstrated that nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles released by tumors promote cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. Within these oncogenic vesicles, we identified a key component that functions as a potent modulator of cancer aggressiveness. By inhibiting this functional component of EVs using a neutralizing antibody, tumor growth was profoundly attenuated in mice. This hints at a potentially effective therapeutic alternative for patients with cancer."

To determine the roles of exosomal miR-203a-3p, an in vivo and in vitro investigation was conducted. The mechanism by which exosomal miR-203a-3p governs the interaction between CRC cells and M2 macrophages was investigated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, western blot, and other techniques; (3) Results: Overexpression of miR-203a-3p was associated with poor prognosis and liver metastasis in CRC patients.

Therefore, it is an urgent issue to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis of invasive BC for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here, we clarified a novel role of exosomes containing ErbB2 and CRK in a formation of premetastatic niches and subsequent metastases. CRK adaptors were overexpressed in invasive UM-UC-3 BC cells. In an orthotopic xenograft model, metastases to lung, liver, and bone of UM-UC-3 cells were completely abolished by CRK elimination. Mass spectrometry analysis identified that ErbB2 was contained in UM-UC-3-derived exosomes in a CRK-dependent manner; the exosomes significantly increased proliferation and invasion properties of low-grade 5637 BC cells and HUVECs through FAK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In athymic mice educated with UM-UC-3-derived exosomes, i.v. implanted UM-UC-3 cells were trapped with surrounding PKH67-labeled exosomes in lung and led to development of lung metastasis with disordered vascular proliferation. In contrast, exosomes derived from CRK-depleted BC cells failed to induce these malignant features. Taken together, we showed that CRK adaptors elevated the expression of ErbB2/3 in BC cells, and these tyrosine kinase/adaptor units were transferred from host BC cells to metastatic recipient cells by exosomes, leading to vascular leakiness and proliferation and contributing to the formation of distant metastasis. Thus, CRK intervention with ErbB2/3 blockade might be a potent therapeutic strategy for patients with ErbB2 overexpressing advanced and metastatic BC."

The hypoxic growth conditions for the H9C2 cells were established using the AnaeroPack method. Treatment conditions tested included H9C2 cells pre-incubated with exosomes, transfected with miR-144 mimics or inhibitor, or treated with the PTEN inhibitor SF1670, all under hypoxic growth conditions. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using 7-ADD and Annexin V together. The expression levels of the miRNAs were detected by real-time PCR, and the expression levels of AKT/p-AKT, Bcl-2, caspase-3, HIF-1α, PTEN, and Rac-1 were measured by both real-time PCR and western blotting. Exosomes were readily internalized by H9C2 cells after co-incubation for 12 h. Exosome-mediated protection of H9C2 cells from apoptosis was accompanied by increasing levels of p-AKT. MiR-144 was found to be highly enriched in MSC-derived exosomes. Transfection of cells with a miR-144 inhibitor weakened exosome-mediated protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of cells grown in hypoxic conditions with miR-144 mimics resulted in decreased PTEN expression, increased p-AKT expression, and prevented H9C2 cell apoptosis, whereas treatment with a miR-144 inhibitor resulted in increased PTEN expression, decreased p-AKT expression, and enhanced H9C2 cell apoptosis in hypoxic conditions.

In this review, we provide a detailed overview of six key pathways in angiogenesis post-MI: the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, the Notch signaling pathway, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, the Hippo signaling pathway, the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. We also discuss novel therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways, including drug therapy, gene therapy, protein therapy, cell therapy, and extracellular vesicle therapy. A comprehensive understanding of these key pathways and their targeted therapies will aid in our understanding of the pathological and physiological mechanisms of angiogenesis after MI and the development and application of new treatment strategies."

We find that ROS production in the injured sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia requires CX3CR1-dependent recruitment of inflammatory cells. Next, exosomes containing functional NADPH oxidase 2 complexes are released from macrophages and incorporated into injured axons via endocytosis. Once in axonal endosomes, active NOX2 is retrogradely transported to the cell body through an importin-β1-dynein-dependent mechanism. Endosomal NOX2 oxidizes PTEN, which leads to its inactivation, thus stimulating PI3K-phosporylated (p-)Akt signalling and regenerative outgrowth.

Anisodamine (654-1/-2) has potentials in alleviating cardiac and endothelial impairments associated with sepsis. Exosomes, small vesicles secreted by cells, carry various bioactive molecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. These vesicles can travel to target cells to influence their function and modulating biological processes. In the context of endothelial-cardiac crosstalk, exosomes derived from endothelial cells can transfer signals that either exacerbate or mitigate myocardial injury, playing a crucial role in the progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, the precise role of endothelial-cardiac crosstalk, particularly through exosomes, in mediating the cardioprotective effects of anisodamine remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of anisodamine on myocardial and endothelial injuries induced by LPS. Mechanisms were analyzed through network pharmacology, molecular docking, Western blotting, and RT-qPCR. The interaction between endothelial and cardiomyocyte inflammatory responses to anisodamine was assessed using a co-culture assay. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of anisodamine-/LPS- treated HUVECs exosomes on A16 cell and myocardial function in mice. Anisodamine effectively mitigated apoptosis, inflammation, mitochondrial and myocardial injury, glycocalyx degradation, and oxidative stress by regulating the PI3K-AKT, NLRP-3/Caspase-1/ASC, TNF-α/PKCα/eNOs/NO, and NF-κB/iNOs/NO pathways in A16 cells and HUVECs. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro assays confirmed the protective effects of anisodamine against myocardial injuries mediated by exosomes derived from LPS-treated HUVECs. In summary, anisodamine ameliorated inflammation-induced endothelial and cardiomyocyte dysfunction. The in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that anisodamine could alleviate myocardial dysfunction through exosome-mediated mechanisms, offering new therapeutic avenues for treating myocardial injury and highlighting the potential of targeted exosome therapy in clinical settings."

Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, figure prominently in the bioactivities of these cells. However, a head-to-head comparison of exosomes from the two cell types has not been performed yet. CPCs and BMCs were derived from cardiac atrial appendage specimens and sternal bone marrow, respectively, from patients (n = 20; age, 69.9 ± 10.9) undergoing heart surgery for aortic valve disease and/or coronary artery disease. Vesicles were purified from cell conditioned media by centrifugation/filtration and ultracentrifugation. Vesicle preparations were predominantly composed of exosomes based on particle size and marker expression (CD9, CD63, CD81, Alix, and TSG-101). CPC-secreted exosomes prevented staurosporine-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis more effectively than BMC-secreted exosomes. In vivo, CPC-secreted exosomes reduced scar size and improved ventricular function after permanent coronary occlusion in rats more efficiently than BMC-secreted exosomes. Both types of exosomes stimulated blood vessel formation. CPC-secreted exosomes, but not BMC-derived exosomes, enhanced ventricular function after ischaemia/reperfusion. Proteomics profiling identified pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) as one of the most highly enriched proteins in CPC vs. BMC exosomes. The active form of PAPP-A was detected on CPC exosome surfaces. These vesicles released insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) via proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4), resulting in IGF-1 receptor activation, intracellular Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, decreased caspase activation, and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. PAPP-A knockdown prevented CPC exosome-mediated cardioprotection both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that CPC-secreted exosomes may be more cardioprotective than BMC-secreted exosomes, and that PAPP-A-mediated IGF-1 release may explain the benefit. They illustrate a general mechanism whereby exosomes may function via an active protease on their surface, which releases a ligand in proximity to the transmembrane receptor bound by the ligand."

AR expression was detected in liver tissue of fibrosis patients and mouse models. The role and mechanism of AR in fibrosis progression were investigated in AR knockout mice and cell lines. AR expression was increased in liver from patients with fibrosis and mouse models. The knockout of AR protected against CCL4 or HFD induced liver injury and development of fibrosis. Furthermore, AR promoted ubiquitization degradation of HUR through competitive binding with OTUB1, thereby exacerbating the accumulation of ROS, and ultimately activating PI3K/AKT pathway. The impaired autophagolysosome resulted in the massive release of exosomes, which activated stellate cells by regulating PTP4a1/SMAD3 pathway.

We found that ADSC-sEVs contain tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) whose overexpression inhibited ER stress in vivo by modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.

To test the hypothesis that the inhibition of I/R-induced apoptosis and autophagy play a pivotal role in the cardioprotection of hMSC-Exo. Myoblast H9c2 cells and isolated rat hearts underwent hypoxia/re-oxygenate (H/R) or ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) respectively. H9c2 were treated with 1.0 μg/ml Exo, in comparison with 3-MA or rapamycin (Rapa), a known anti- or pro-autophagic agent respectively. Hearts were treated with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 μg/ml Exo for 20 min in the beginning of reperfusion. Cell viability, WST assay, LDH release, Annexin-V staining apoptosis assay and GFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes formation, cardiac function and Western blot were measured. Exo significantly reduced H/R injury as indicated by increased cell viability and reduced LDH and apoptosis. 3-MA, while Rapa, showed increased or decreased protective effects. Rapa-induced injury was partially blocked by Exo. Exo decreased LC3-II/I ratio and increased p62, inhibited autophagosome formation, an indication of autophagy inhibition. In isolated heart, Exo increased cardiac functional recovery and reduced LDH release in I/R. Bcl-2 was significantly upregulated by Exo but not 3-MA. Exo downregulated Traf6 and upregulated mTORC1/p-4eBP1. Exo reduce I/R-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Up-regulation of Bcl-2 is the cross-talk between these two processes. The down-regulation of Traf6 and activation of mTORC1 are additional mechanisms in the inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy."

To investigate the role of exercise-derived circulating exosomes in cardioprotection and the molecular mechanisms involved. Circulating exosomes were isolated from the plasma of volunteers with or without exercise training and rats subjected to 4-week swim exercise or sedentary littermates 24 hours after the last training session. Although the total circulating exosome level did not change significantly in exercised subjects 24 hours post-exercise compared with the sedentary control, the isolated plasma exosomes from exercised rats afforded remarkable protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. miRNA sequencing combined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validation identified 12 differentially expressed miRNAs from the circulating exosomes of exercised rats, among which miR-342-5p stood out as the most potent cardioprotective molecule. Importantly, the cardioprotective effects and the elevation of exosomal miR-342-5p were also observed in exercise-trained human volunteers. Moreover, inhibition of miR-342-5p significantly blunted the protective effects of exercise-derived circulating exosomes in hypoxia/reoxygenation cardiomyocytes; in vivo cardiac-specific inhibition of miR-342-5p through serotype 9 adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery attenuated exercise-afforded cardioprotection in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion rats. Mechanistically, miR-342-5p inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via targeting Caspase 9 and Jnk2; it also enhanced survival signaling (p-Akt) via targeting phosphatase gene Ppm1f. Of note, exercise training or laminar shear stress directly enhanced the synthesis of miR-342-5p in endothelial cells.

However, due to lack of an established animal models, the underlying mechanism of disturbed cardiac repair accompanied with sarcopenia remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel sarcopenia-induced cardiac repair disturbance mouse model induced by tail suspension (TS) after cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Importantly, we identified a specific exosomal-microRNA marker, miR-16-5p, in the circulating exosomes of I/R-TS mice. Of note, sarcopenia after I/R disturbed cardiac repair and raised the level of circulating-exosomal-miR-16-5p secreting from both the atrophic limbs and heart of TS mice. Likewise, miR-16-5p mimic plasmid disturbed cardiac repair in I/R mice directly. Additionally, in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) cultured in vitro under hypoxic conditions in the presence of a miR-16-5p mimic, we observed increased apoptosis through p53 and Caspase3 upregulation, and also clarified that autophagosomes were decreased in NRVMs via SESN1 transcript interference-mediated mTOR activation. In conclusion, we show the pro-apoptotic effect of sarcopenia-derived miR-16-5p, which may be behind the exacerbation of myocardial infarction. Therefore, miR-16-5p can be a novel therapeutic target in the context of cardiac repair disturbances in sarcopenia-cachexia."

Next, cardiomyocytes H9C2 were co-cultured with MSC-EVs and internalization of EVs was evaluated, followed by evaluation of whether EVs could transmit miR-29a-3p cargos into H9C2 cells and affect their biological functions. EVs derived from MSCs were observed to protect against SAP-induced myocardial injury. In SAP-induced rats, miR-29a-3p was under-expressed in myocardial tissues. In addition, we also confirmed that miR-29a-3p could be transferred into the H9C2 cardiomyocytes by MSC-derived EVs, which downregulated the expression of inflammatory markers and improve cardiac function to attenuate myocardial injury.

First, we describe the role of ependymal glia in the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid flow from the spinal cord to peripheral tissues through the spinal nerves. This newly discovered pathway provides a highway for the CNS-body volume transmission. Next, we present the mechanism by which astrocytes control migration and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In pre- and early postnatal CNS, OPCs migrate using vasculature (which is yet free from glia limitans perivascularis) as a pathfinder. Newly forming astrocytic perivascular endfeet signal (through semaphorin-plexin cascade) to OPCs that detach from the vessels and start to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes.

Pathophysiological processes such as cellular inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis, immune dysfunction, and oxidative stress are closely associated with miRNAs. Internal and external factors such as tissue ischemia, hypoxia, pathogen infection, and endotoxin exposure can trigger these reactions and are linked to miRNAs. Paraquat-induced fibrosis is a protracted process that may not manifest immediately after injury but develops during bodily recovery, providing insights into potential miRNA intervention treatments. These findings could potentially be applied for further pharmaceutical research and clinical therapy of paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and are likely to be of great interest to clinicians involved in lung fibrosis research. Through a literature review, we identified an association between miR-15a-5p and miR-152-3p and their involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway. This allowed us to deduce the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory interactions involved in paraquat-induced lung fibrosis. miR-15a-5p and miR-152-3p play roles in body repair processes, and pulmonary fibrosis can be considered a form of reparative response by the body.

Recent evidences allude that EVs can mediate both protective and pathogenic effects depending on the precise state. In this review, we discuss the involvement of EVs as mediators of signal transduction in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In addition, the role of EVs in mediating Wnt and PI3K signaling pathways is also discussed. Additional findings on the involvement of EVs in homeostasis and disease progression will promote a better biological understanding, advance future therapeutic, and diagnostic applications."

This study aims to investigate how extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSC) regulate Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB 1) and influence Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in PD model. The PD model was induced by damaging SH-SY5Y cells and mice using 6-OHDA. According to the study, administering EVs every other day for 14 days improved the motor behavior of 6-OHDA-induced PD mice and reduced neuronal damage, including dopaminergic neurons. Treatment with EVs for 12 hours increased the viability of 6-OHDA-induced SH-SY5Y cells. The upregulation of SATB 1 expression with EV treatment resulted in the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PD model and led to overexpression of β-catenin. Meanwhile, the expression of LC3 II was decreased, indicating alterations in autophagy. In conclusion, EVs could mitigate neuronal damage in the 6-OHDA-induced PD model by upregulating SATB 1 and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway while also regulating autophagy. Further studies on the potential therapeutic applications of EVs for PD could offer new insights and strategies."

Emerging evidence reveals dynamic bidirectional crosstalk between these systems mediated by hormones, cytokines, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and neural signals. Bone-derived factors such as osteocalcin (OCN), lipocalin-2, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 influence cognitive functions, mood, and neurogenesis, while brain- and nerve-derived mediators, including leptin, serotonin, and sympathetic signals, modulate bone remodeling. Inflammation and aging disrupt this communication, contributing to cognitive decline, osteoporosis, and other age-related disorders. Stem cells and EVs have also been implicated as mediators in this axis, offering insights into regenerative strategies. Molecular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators, such as Wnt/β-catenin, leptin, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), sclerostin (SOST), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), play critical roles in maintaining bone-brain homeostasis. Additionally, shared biomarkers and pathological links between neurodegeneration and bone loss suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. Studies support this inter-organ communication, yet further mechanistic and translational research is needed. This review highlights the molecular basis of bone-brain crosstalk, emphasizing inflammation, aging, and regulatory pathways, with a focus on future directions in biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting.

However, they differ in age of onset and clinical progression. Emerging evidence highlights primary cilia (PC) as a key regulator of neuronal aging and the progression of these diseases. Dysfunctional PC may impair key signaling pathways, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt, promote oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and epigenetic instability. PC may also influence intercellular communication by regulating the biogenesis of exosomes and modulating tunneling nanotube (TNT) formation, both of which propagate toxic proteins between neurons. Mechanistically, the regulation of ciliary length is disrupted in AD, which leads to ciliary dysfunction that interferes with signaling pathways and promotes the aggregation of amyloid-beta. This amyloid-beta is then propagated through TNTs and exosomes, spreading neuronal damage. In PD, the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) also impairs cilia function, thereby compromising the cell's response to oxidative stress. This results in the formation of abnormal TNTs and defective exosome-mediated clearance, ultimately contributing to neurodegeneration. Similarly, the mutant huntingtin protein aggregates within primary cilia in HD, morphologically disrupting them by obstructing intraflagellar transport. Damaged cilia are also associated with increased TNT formation and the exosomal release of toxic proteins, which leads to mitochondrial and epigenetic instability, ultimately promoting neuronal aging. Together, targeting ciliary function and its downstream regulation of TNTs and exosomes may provide a novel approach for slowing or halting disease progression across neurodegenerative diseases."

Initially, EVs were associated to a mechanism involved in the elimination of unwanted material; subsequent evidence demonstrated that exosomes, and more in general EVs, play a key role in intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA to target cells. Recently, EVs have emerged as potent carriers for Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, miRNA secretion and extracellular traveling. Convincing evidence demonstrates that presynaptic terminals release exosomes that are taken up by muscle cells, and these exosomes can modulate synaptic plasticity in the recipient muscle cell in vivo. Furthermore, recent data highlighted that EVs could also be a potential cause of neurodegenerative disorders.

This review intends to synthesize emerging frameworks that reposition neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as progressive breakdowns of interpretive cellular logic, rather than mere terminal consequences of protein aggregation or synaptic attrition. The discussion aims to provide a detailed mapping of how critical signaling pathways-including PI3K-AKT-mTOR, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and integrated stress response cascades-undergo spatial and temporal disintegration. Special attention is directed toward the roles of RNA-binding proteins (e.g., TDP-43, FUS, ELAVL2), m6A epitranscriptomic modifiers (METTL3, YTHDF1, IGF2BP1), and non-canonical post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, crotonylation) in disrupting translation fidelity, proteostasis, and subcellular targeting. At the organelle level, the review seeks to highlight how the failure of ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), autophagosome-lysosome fusion machinery (STX17, SNAP29), and mitochondrial import/export systems (TIM/TOM complexes) generates cumulative stress and impairs neuronal triage. These dysfunctions are compounded by mitochondrial protease overload (LONP1, CLPP), UPR maladaptation, and phase-transitioned stress granules that sequester nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins and ribosomal subunits, especially in ALS and FTD contexts. Synaptic disassembly is treated not only as a downstream event, but as an early tipping point, driven by impaired PSD scaffolding, aberrant endosomal recycling (Rab5, Rab11), complement-mediated pruning (C1q/C3-CR3 axis), and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance linked to parvalbumin interneuron decay. Using insights from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, the review illustrates how regional vulnerability to proteostatic and metabolic stress converges with signaling noise to produce entropic attractor collapse within core networks such as the DMN, SN, and FPCN. By framing neurodegeneration as an active loss of cellular and network ""meaning-making""-a collapse of coordinated signal interpretation, triage prioritization, and adaptive response-the review aims to support a more integrative conceptual model. In this context, therapeutic direction may shift from damage containment toward restoring high-dimensional neuronal agency, via strategies that include the following elements: reprogrammable proteome-targeting agents (e.g., PROTACs), engineered autophagy adaptors, CRISPR-based BDNF enhancers, mitochondrial gatekeeping stabilizers, and glial-exosome neuroengineering. This synthesis intends to offer a translational scaffold for viewing neurodegeneration as not only a disorder of accumulation but as a systems-level failure of cellular reasoning-a perspective that may inform future efforts in resilience-based intervention and precision neurorestoration."

Transcriptomic profiling of microglia revealed key gene networks implicated in DPN pathology and responsive to SIN treatment. Functional assays demonstrated that ZH-1c-EVs@SIN facilitated a shift in microglial phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2, significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, and restored levels of neuronal regulatory proteins. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed optimal vesicle size and morphology, while fluorescence imaging showed efficient uptake by microglia. In vivo studies in a murine model of DPN revealed marked improvements in pain-related behavior and histopathological signs of nerve damage.

Moreover, myotube treatment with NSC-34-derived EVs led to GSK3β and JNK phosphorylation, followed by β-catenin nuclear translocation, suggesting that neuron-derived EVs can induce AChR clustering through Wnt pathway activation. These data demonstrate that EVs released from differentiated motor neurons carry multimodal signals, miRNAs, and Wnts, which can stimulate AChR clustering in myotubes, a fundamental preparatory stage for NMJ formation. These new data highlight that EVs may play a role in the NMJ establishment and function under physiological and pathological conditions, particularly neurodegenerative diseases."

In this study, we utilized exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs-Exos). We performed sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of exosome-treated cells to demonstrate that HUMSCs-Exos can stimulate myelin gene expression in oigodendrocyte precursor cells. Functional investigations revealed that HUMSCs-Exos activate the Pi3k/Akt pathway and regulate the Tbr1/Wnt signaling molecules through the transfer of miR-23a-3p, promoting oligodendrocytes differentiation and enhancing the expression of myelin-related proteins. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, treatment with HUMSCs-Exos significantly improved neurological function and facilitated remyelination.

Chemobrain was induced by exposing rats to DOX (2 mg/kg, i.p) once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. After 48 h of the last DOX dose, a subset of rats was supplied with either an intravenous injection of BMSCs (1 × 10 BMSCs and BMSCs-Exo successfully restored DOX-induced cognitive and behavioral distortion. These actions were mediated via decreasing hippocampal neurodegeneration and neural demyelination through upregulating neural myelination factors (myelin%, Olig2, Opalin expression), neurotropic growth factors (BDNF, FGF-2), synaptic factors (synaptophysin), and fractalkine receptor expression (Cx3cr1). Halting neurodegeneration in DOX-induced chemobrain was achieved through epigenetic induction of key factors in Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways mediated primarily by the most abundant secreted exosomal miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-24-3p, let-7a-5p). Moreover, BMSCs and BMSCs-Exo significantly abrogate the inflammatory state (IL-6, TNF-α), apoptotic state (BAX/Bcl2), astrocyte, and microglia activation (GFAP, IBA-1) in DOX-induced chemobrain with a significant increase in the antioxidant mediators (GSH, GPx, SOD activity). BMSCs and their derived exosomes offer neuroprotection against DOX-induced chemobrain via genetic and epigenetic abrogation of hippocampal neurodegeneration through modulating Wnt/β-catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways and through reducing inflammatory, apoptotic, and oxidative stress state.

Hence, we conducted the first comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of PDD plasma SEV. We investigated plasma SEV RNA of PDD, PD, and people without PD or dementia (Controls) using RNA-Seq (n = 15/group; N = 45). SEV were separated by ultracentrifugation, and characterized by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PDD plasma SEV using an edgeR-based data analysis pipeline and verified them by high-throughput qPCR. We assessed functional implications of identified DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway and causal network analyses. We identified 51 transcriptome-wide significant (edgeR q < 0.05) DEGs, compared to controls, and 26 transcriptome-wide significant DEGs, compared to PD, in PDD plasma SEV. The identified DEGs, which included WNT5A, MAPT, FOSB, MIR324, MIR574, MIR3161, and MIR6821 were significantly enriched among Tetrahydrofolate salvage, Reelin signalling, tRNA splicing, Wnt signalling, and ERBB signalling pathways. We identified eight potential multiplex plasma SEV RNA biomarker assays that can distinguish PDD from PD with at least 80 % sensitivity and specificity using an artificial intelligence-based algorithm. Future research on the identified dysfunctional molecular pathways may facilitate discovery of novel therapeutic targets for PDD. Diagnostic biomarker potential of the derived multiplex RNA biomarker assays should be investigated by larger clinical studies."

Based on evidence astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles (astrocyte derived EVs) regulate neuronal functions, and data that inflammatory cytokines can modify the molecular cargo of astrocyte derived EVs, we sought to determine if IL-1β promotes the formation of Aβ indirectly through actions of astrocyte derived EVs on neurons. The production of Aβ was increased when neurons were exposed to astrocyte derived EVs shed in response to IL-1β (astrocyte derived EV-IL-1β).

In particular, EVs secreted by human stem cells show significance in treating neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and ischemic stroke. However, the clinical applications of EVs are limited due to their poor targeting capabilities and low therapeutic efficacies after intravenous administration. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles are biocompatible and have been shown to improve the targeting ability of EVs. In particular, ultrasmall SPIO (USPIO, <50 nm) are more suitable for labeling nanoscale EVs due to their small size. In this study, induced forebrain neural progenitor cortical organoids (iNPCo) were differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and the iNPCo expressed FOXG1, Nkx2.1, α-catenin, as well as β-tubulin III. EVs were isolated from iNPCo media, then loaded with USPIOs by sonication. Size and concentration of EV particles were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis, and no significant changes were observed in size distribution before and after sonication, but the concentration decreased after labeling. miR-21 and miR-133b decreased after sonication. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated contrast visualized for the USPIO labeled EVs embedded in agarose gel phantoms. Upon calculation, USPIO labeled EVs exhibited considerably shorter relaxation times, quantified as T2 and T2* values, reducing the signal intensity and generating higher MRI contrast compared to unlabeled EVs and gel only. Our study demonstrated that USPIO labeling was a feasible approach for in vitro tracking of brain organoid-derived EVs, which paves the way for further in vivo examination."

Human ADSCs isolated from 24 healthy donors and 24 patients with neurological disorders (ND) were cultured and induced for Neu-Dif. The mechanism of action of ATP6AP2 and the impact of its localization within the plasma membrane (particularly CLR-Ms) and intracellular sites on several pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt(s) signaling and others) and intracellular calcium and exosome release were evaluated. The impact of CLR-Ms on ATP6AP2 or vice versa was determined by pharmacological disruption of CLR-Ms or siATP6AP2 assays. In patients with ND, loss of ATP6AP2 from CLR-Ms correlated with an inhibition of Neu-Dif and signaling. However, its relocalization in CLR-Ms was positively correlated to induction of Neu-Dif in healthy subjects. An apparent switch from canonical to noncanonical Wnt signaling as well as from caveolin to flotillin occurs concurrently with the increases of ATP6AP2 expression during neurogenesis.

Total RNA was extracted from extracellular vesicles (EVs) from peripheral blood samples collected before and after 14 days of rehabilitation in the hospital. Differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were identified via next-generation sequencing (NGS), and a coexpression network was constructed. Overall, 3038 DEmRNAs (2337 upregulated/701 downregulated) and 1723 DElncRNAs (1278 upregulated/445 downregulated) were identified between prerehabilitation (prerehab) PWPs and HCs, whereas 3117 DEmRNAs (2490 upregulated/629 downregulated) and 1931 DElncRNAs (1561 upregulated/370 downregulated) were identified between postrehabilitation (postrehab) PWPs and HCs.

We investigated the RNA content from EVs isolated from saliva (salEVs) to determine if we could detect transcripts associated with neurodegenerative conditions. We characterized the RNA cargo of salEVs isolated from individuals over the age of 65 with normal cognition. The salEV RNA content was analyzed by RNA-seq and NanoString miRNA analysis. We found approximately 48.4% of the reads mapped to the human genome, with the remainder mapping to prokaryotic genomes. The transcripts included protein-coding RNA, long non-coding RNA, retrotransposons, and miRNAs. A significant number of the protein-coding transcripts were associated with pathways involved in neurodegenerative conditions. In addition, there was an enrichment of transcripts containing AP-2ε, HEYL, HES4, and TCFL5 transcription factor binding sites. We found that the lncRNA content was similar between samples, with PCBP1-AS1, TEX41, and PVT1 being the top represented transcripts. There were 286 miRNAs found in the salEV samples. The pathways predicted to be affected by the top represented miRNAs include Hippo signaling, TGF-β signaling, Wnt signaling, FoxO signaling, ErbB signaling, axon guidance, and mTOR signaling. We could detect retrotransposon transcripts from LINE, SINE, and LTR elements in salEVs. When compared to blood-derived EVs, salEVs showed greater representation of transcripts associated with neurodegenerative pathways. Our results indicate that salEVs contain transcripts that are associated with pathways involved in neurodegeneration. The presence of these transcripts in salEVs suggest that saliva may be used to screen for biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases."

Comprising of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular vesicles enriched with bioactive miRNAs, the hUC-MSC secretome exerts its effects primarily through paracrine signaling. For this review, relevant literature was collected from established databases, including ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using key terms such as ""hUC-MSC secretome,"" ""chronic inflammation,"" ""exosomes,"" ""tumor microenvironment,"" and ""preconditioning."" The search focused on studies published within the last five years, emphasizing in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, original research, and review articles. Only studies specifically exploring hUC-MSC-derived secretomes were included, whereas those addressing cell-based therapies or secretomes from other MSC sources were excluded. Cumulative findings indicate that the hUC-MSC secretome alleviates chronic inflammation by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as regulatory miRNAs such as miR-29a-3p, miR-100-5p, and miR-125b-5p, which act via key signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT.

By analyzing the effects of different immune cells on brain dysfunction associated with this disease, we aim to explore the various mechanisms through which autoimmune and acquired immune cells in peripheral circulation and the central nervous system contribute to disease development. Additionally, we seek to identify potential therapeutic modalities targeting these immune cells. In innate immunity, treatment targeting different monocyte loci includes four main modalities: cytokines (CSF1R, MIF, P2X7, CX3CR1, and CCL2), signaling pathways (DAP12/TREM, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin), tissue engineering (mitochondrial transplantation and exosomes), and traditional Chinese medicines. Treatment targeting different dendritic cell loci encompasses two modalities: signaling pathway (cGAS/STING/NF-κB) and tissue engineering (tolerogenic dendritic cells and engineered probiotics). For natural killer cells, treatment targeting different loci includes two modalities: tissue engineering (natural killer cell-based immunotherapies) and traditional Chinese medicines (Tongxinluo capsule). In adaptive immunity, treatment targeting different T cell loci includes four modalities: cytokines (S1PR and RXR), signaling pathway (Nrf2/GPX4 and Notch-ITGB1), tissue engineering (elimination of senescent T cells, monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta protofibrils, nanovaccines, and nanomedicines), and traditional Chinese medicines (traditional herbal remedies and microneedle therapy). Treatment targeting different B cell loci includes three modalities: monoclonal antibodies (targeting CD49d and CD20), purine glycoside analogs (Cladribine), and plasma exchange.

The disease is characterized by the crucial role played by signaling and interactions between immune cells and components of the neurovascular unit, which is a functional complex composed of neurons, glial cells, and microvessels that regulate inflammatory responses and tissue repair. The central nervous system lacks intrinsic regenerative capacity, and currently, there is no effective method to fully restore its function. The primary focus of current research is on utilizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to create environments that facilitate cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Hydrogels, induced pluripotent stem cells, exosomes, regulatory T cell transplants, and gene modification are key areas of focus in neural regeneration research. In the future, immune rejuvenation and other emerging therapies may offer potential treatment strategies for cerebral small vessel disease.

High intratumoral nerve density correlates with poor prognosis and high recurrence across multiple solid tumor types. Recent research has shown that cancer cells express neurotrophic markers such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor and release axon-guidance molecules such as ephrin B1 to promote axonogenesis. Tumor cells recruit new neural progenitors to the tumor milieu and facilitate their maturation into adrenergic infiltrating nerves. Tumors also rewire established nerves to adrenergic phenotypes via exosome-induced neural reprogramming by p53-deficient tumors. In turn, infiltrating sympathetic nerves facilitate cancer progression. Intratumoral adrenergic nerves release noradrenaline to stimulate angiogenesis via VEGF signaling and enhance the rate of tumor growth. Intratumoral parasympathetic nerves may have a dichotomous role in cancer progression and may induce Wnt-β-catenin signals that expand cancer stem cells. Importantly, infiltrating nerves not only influence the tumor cells themselves but also impact other cells of the tumor stroma. This leads to enhanced sympathetic signaling and glucocorticoid production, which influences neutrophil and macrophage differentiation, lymphocyte phenotype, and potentially lymphocyte function. Although much remains unexplored within this field, fundamental discoveries underscore the importance of nerve-cancer cross-talk to tumor progression and may provide the foundation for developing effective targets for the inhibition of tumor-induced neurogenesis and tumor progression."

It is identified that MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is enriched in M2 TAM exosomes and confirmed that MALAT1 transfer from M2 TAMs to gastric cancer cells via exosomes mediates this effect. Mechanistically, MALAT1 interacted with the δ-catenin protein and suppressed its ubiquitination and degradation by β-TRCP. In addition, MALAT1 upregulated HIF-1α expression by acting as a sponge for miR-217-5p. The activation of β-catenin and HIF-1α signaling pathways by M2 TAM exosomes collectively led to enhanced aerobic glycolysis in gastric cancer cells. Finally, a dual-targeted inhibition of MALAT1 in both gastric cancer cells and macrophages by exosome-mediated delivery of siRNA remarkably suppressed gastric cancer growth and improved chemosensitivity in mouse tumor models. Taken together, these results suggest that M2 TAMs-derived exosomes promote gastric cancer progression via MALAT1-mediated regulation of glycolysis.

The effect of circCCAR1 on the tumorigenesis and metastasis of HCC was assessed by in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. The function of circCCAR1 in CD8 + T-cell dysfunction was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting and flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, biotinylated RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and MS2 pull-down assays were used to the exploration of mechanism. A mouse model with reconstituted human immune system components (huNSG mice) was constructed to explore the role of exosomal circCCAR1 in the resistance to anti-PD1 therapy in HCC. Increased circCCAR1 levels existed in tumor tissues and exosomes in the plasma of HCC patients, in the culture supernatant and HCC cells. CircCCAR1 accelerated the growth and metastasis of HCC in vitro and in vivo. E1A binding protein p300 (EP300) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3) promoted the biogenesis of circCCAR1, and Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP)-mediated m6A modification enhanced circCCAR1 stability by binding insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3). CircCCAR1 acted as a sponge for miR-127-5p to upregulate its target WTAP and a feedback loop comprising circCCAR1/miR-127-5p/WTAP axis was formed. CircCCAR1 is secreted by HCC cells in a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2B1)-dependent manner. Exosomal circCCAR1 was taken in by CD8 + T cells and caused dysfunction of CD8 + T cells by stabilizing the PD-1 protein. CircCCAR1 promoted resistance to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Furthermore, increased cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) induced by EP300 promoted the binding of CCAR1 and β-catenin protein, which further enhanced the transcription of PD-L1. The circCCAR1/miR-127-5p/WTAP feedback loop enhances the growth and metastasis of HCC. Exosomal circCCAR1 released by HCC cells contributes to immunosuppression by facilitating CD8 + T-cell dysfunction in HCC.

The interaction between LSCC cells and TAMs affects the progression of laryngeal cancer through exosomes, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Proteomics analysis of TAMs isolated from human laryngeal tumor tissues obtained from patients with confirmed lymphatic metastasis revealed an upregulation of annexin A3 (ANXA3). In TAMs, ANXA3 promoted macrophages to polarize to an M2-like phenotype by activating the AKT-GSK3β-β-catenin pathway. In addition, ANXA3-rich exosomes derived from TAMs inhibited ferroptosis in laryngeal cancer cells through an ATF2-CHAC1 axis, and this process was associated with lymphatic metastasis. Mechanistically, ANXA3 in exosomes inhibited the ubiquitination of ATF2, whereas ATF2 acted as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of CHAC1, thus inhibiting ferroptosis in LSCC cells. These data indicate that abnormal ANXA3 expression can drive TAM reprogramming and promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment in LSCC. Meanwhile, ANXA3-rich exosomes inhibit ferroptosis of LSCC cells and promote lymphatic metastasis, thus promoting tumor progression."

This transformation plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and self-renewal, and exacerbates resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy. EMT can be initiated and promoted by deregulated oncogenic signaling pathways, hypoxia, and cells in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a loss-of-epithelial cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion, and enhanced invasive/migratory properties. Numerous transcriptional regulators, such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB1/ZEB2 induce EMT through the downregulation of epithelial markers and gain-of-expression of the mesenchymal markers. Additionally, signaling cascades such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, Sonic hedgehog, nuclear factor kappa B, receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Hippo, and transforming growth factor-β pathways regulate EMT whereas they are often deregulated in cancers leading to aberrant EMT. Furthermore, noncoding RNAs, tumor-derived exosomes, and epigenetic alterations are also involved in the modulation of EMT. Therefore, the regulation of EMT is a vital strategy to control the aggressive metastatic characteristics of tumor cells. Despite the vast amount of preclinical data on EMT in cancer progression, there is a lack of clinical translation at the therapeutic level. In this review, we have discussed thoroughly the role of the aforementioned transcription factors, noncoding RNAs (microRNAs, long noncoding RNA, circular RNA), signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, and tumor-derived exosomes in the regulation of EMT in cancers. We have also emphasized the contribution of EMT to drug resistance and possible therapeutic interventions using plant-derived natural products, their semi-synthetic derivatives, and nano-formulations that are described as promising EMT blockers."

LncRNAs are localized in nucleus and cytoplasm, and their abnormal expression is related to development of tumor. This manuscript emphasizes on the role of lncRNA H19 in various cancers and its association with tumor hallmarks. The function of lncRNA H19 in most tumors is oncogenic and therefore, tumor cells increase its expression for promoting their progression. LncRNA H19 contributes to enhancing growth and cell cycle of cancers and by EMT induction, it is able to elevate metastasis rate. Silencing H19 induces apoptotic cell death and disrupts progression of tumors. LncRNA H19 triggers chemo- and radio-resistance in cancer cells. miRNAs are dually upregulated/down-regulated by lncRNA H19 in increasing tumor progression. Anti-cancer agents reduce lncRNA H19 in impairing tumor progression and increasing therapy sensitivity. A number of downstream targets and molecular pathways for lncRNA H19 have been detected in cancers including miRNAs, RUNX1, STAT3, β-catenin, Akt2 and FOXM1. Clinical studies have revealed potential of lncRNA H19 as biomarker and its association with poor prognosis.

Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) drive cancer metastasis and that their regulatory pathways could be targeted for preventing metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs in CRC metastasis remain poorly understood. Microarray analysis was used to screen for differentially expressed lncRNAs. Transwell assays, fibronectin cell adhesion assays, and mouse metastasis models were utilized to evaluate the metastatic capacities of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin isolation by RNA purification, chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromosome conformation capture were applied to investigate the underlying mechanism involved. qRT‒PCR and transmission electron microscopy were performed to confirm macrophage polarization and the presence of cancer-derived exosomes. The lncRNA RP11-417E7.1 was screened and identified as a novel metastasis-associated lncRNA that was correlated with a poor prognosis. RP11-417E7.1 enhances the metastatic capacity of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, RP11-417E7.1 binding with High mobility group A1 (HMGA1) promotes neighboring thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) transcription via chromatin loop formation between its promoter and enhancer, which activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and facilitates CRC metastasis. Furthermore, exosomes derived from CRC cells transport THBS2 into macrophages, thereby inducing the M2 polarization of macrophages to sustain the prometastatic microenvironment. Notably, netropsin, a DNA-binding drug, suppresses chromatin loop formation mediated by RP11-417E7.1 at the THBS2 locus and significantly inhibits CRC metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

Exosomes were isolated from conditioned medium and serum of CRC patients using ultracentrifugation method and ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation Solution kit, and characterized by transmission electronic microscopy, nanosight and western blot. MicroRNA microarray was employed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes secreted by CAFs or NFs. The internalization of exosomes, transfer of miR-92a-3p was observed by immunofluorescence. Boyden chamber migration and invasion, cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, plate colony formation, sphere formation assays, tail vein injection and primary colon cancer liver metastasis assays were employed to explore the effect of NFs, CAFs and exosomes secreted by them on epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance of CRC. Luciferase report assay, real-time qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry staining were employed to explore the regulation of CRC metastasis and chemotherapy resistance by miR-92a-3p, FBXW7 and MOAP1. CAFs promote the stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis and chemotherapy resistance of CRC cells. Importantly, CAFs exert their roles by directly transferring exosomes to CRC cells, leading to a significant increase of miR-92a-3p level in CRC cells. Mechanically, increased expression of miR-92a-3p activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway and inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis by directly inhibiting FBXW7 and MOAP1, contributing to cell stemness, EMT, metastasis and 5-FU/L-OHP resistance in CRC. Clinically, miR-92a-3p expression is significantly increased in CRC tissues and negatively correlated with the levels of FBXW7 and MOAP1 in CRC specimens, and high expression of exosomal miR-92a-3p in serum was highly linked with metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in CRC patients. CAFs secreted exosomes promote metastasis and chemotherapy resistance of CRC. Inhibiting exosomal miR-92a-3p provides an alternative modality for the prediction and treatment of metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in CRC."

Multiple mechanisms of how these signaling cascades and EVs interplay to mediate these complex processes have been described, such as direct signal activation through pathway components on or in EVs or indirectly by influencing vesicle biogenesis, cargo sorting, or uptake dynamics. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of EVs, their biogenesis, and our understanding of EV interactions with recipient cells with a focus on selected oncogenic and cancer-associated signaling pathways.

This is accomplished by the expression of osteoblast markers (e.g. alkaline phosphatase) and the production of bone matrix proteins and paracrine factors which deregulate the physiology of bone, fuelling the so-called ""vicious cycle"". The main challenge of researchers is therefore to identify the genetic profile determining the osteotropism of tumour cells, which would eventually lead to bone colonisation. This could likely provide the answer to a quite intriguing question, that is why some cancers, such as prostate and breast, have a specific predilection to metastasise to the bone.

Notably, SLC12A2-DT-induced M2 macrophage polarization significantly induced lung metastasis in a murine HCC model. We subsequently confirmed that HCC cell-derived exosomal SLC12A2-DT induced M2 macrophage polarization by specifically binding to GSK3β/β-catenin and downregulating the degradation of ubiquitinated β-catenin, leading to Wnt signaling pathway activation.

Despite improvements in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, survival rates for relapsed or metastatic disease remain poor. Recent advances in understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and exosome biology have uncovered critical mechanisms driving osteosarcoma progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), particularly the M2 phenotype, dominate the osteosarcoma immune landscape and contribute to immunosuppression through cytokine secretion and modulation of T cell function. Exosomes, as intercellular messengers, further exacerbate tumor progression by transporting oncogenic proteins, immunosuppressive factors (TGF-β), miRNAs, and drug-resistance molecules. These vesicles also influence critical signaling cascades including Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β pathways, shaping both local and systemic tumor responses. This review delineates the roles of immune cells and tumor-derived exosomes in osteosarcoma biology and evaluates emerging immunotherapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, tumor vaccines, cytokine-targeted agents, and combination therapies. We highlight ongoing clinical trials, numerical efficacy metrics, and the translational promise of exosome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. Ultimately, integrated approaches targeting both the TIME and exosome-mediated mechanisms may yield more effective and durable treatments for osteosarcoma patients."

The unbalance of physiological signalling pathways due to the acquisition of mutations in tumour cells is considered the most common cancer driver. The Wingless-related integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway is crucial for tissue development and homeostasis in all animal species and its dysregulation is one of the most relevant events linked to cancer development and dissemination. The canonical and the non-canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathways are known to control both physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Herein, the impact of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade in driving cancers from different origin has been examined.

GOLPH3 overexpression has been reported in several human solid cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the molecular mechanisms that link GOLPH3 to tumorigenesis require further investigation, it is likely that GOLPH3 may act by controlling the intracellular movement of key oncogenic molecules, between the Golgi compartments and/or between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, numerous evidence indicates that deregulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking contributes to several aspects of cancer phenotypes. However, a direct and clear link between extracellular vesicle movements and GOLPH3 is still missing. In the past years several lines of evidence have implicated GOLPH3 in the regulation of extracellular vesicle content. Specifically, a new role for GOLPH3 has emerged in controlling the internalization of exosomes containing either oncogenic proteins or noncoding RNAs, especially micro-RNA. Although far from being elucidated, growing evidence indicates that GOLPH3 does not increase quantitatively the excretion of exosomes, but rather regulates the exosome content. In particular, recent data support a role for GOLPH3 for loading specific oncogenic molecules into the exosomes, driving both tumor malignancy and metastasis formation. Additionally, the older literature indirectly implicates GOLPH3 in cancerogenesis through its function in controlling hepatitis C virus secretion, which in turn is linked to hepatocellular carcinoma formation. Thus, GOLPH3 might promote tumorigenesis in unexpected ways, involving both direct and indirect routes. If these data are further confirmed, the spectrum of action of GOLPH3 in tumor formation will significantly expand, indicating this protein as a strong candidate for targeted cancer therapy."

Indeed, hypoxic extracellular vesicles are known to trigger a variety of angiogenic responses via different mechanisms. We recently showed that hypoxia promotes endosomal signaling in tumor cells via HIF-1α-dependent induction of the guanine exchange factor ALS2, which activates Rab5, leading to downstream events involved in cell migration and invasion. Since Rab5-dependent signaling is required for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, we explored the possibility that hypoxia promotes the release of small extracellular vesicles containing ALS2, which in turn activate Rab5 in recipient endothelial cells leading to pro-angiogenic properties. In doing so, we found that hypoxia promoted ALS2 expression and incorporation as cargo within small extracellular vesicles, leading to subsequent transfer to recipient endothelial cells and promoting cell migration, tube formation, and downstream Rab5 activation. Consequently, ALS2-containing small extracellular vesicles increased early endosome size and number in recipient endothelial cells, which was followed by subsequent sequestration of components of the β-catenin destruction complex within endosomal compartments, leading to stabilization and nuclear localization of β-catenin. These events converged in the expression of β-catenin target genes involved in angiogenesis. Knockdown of ALS2 in donor tumor cells precluded its incorporation into small extracellular vesicles, preventing Rab5-downstream events and endothelial cell responses, which depended on Rab5 activity and guanine exchange factor activity of ALS2. These findings indicate that vesicular ALS2, secreted in hypoxia, promotes endothelial cell events leading to angiogenesis. Finally, these events might explain how tumor angiogenesis proceeds in hypoxic conditions."

Hypoxia also enhances the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), enriched with pro-metastatic cargos, and upregulates bone-homing molecules including CXCR4, integrins, and PIM kinases, fostering pre-metastatic niche formation and skeletal colonisation. In this review, we analysed current evidence on how hypoxia orchestrates PCa dissemination to bone, focusing on the molecular crosstalk between HIF signalling, Wnt activation, EV-mediated communication, and cellular plasticity.

Here, we aimed to explore the role of CAF-derived exosome miR-148b-3p in bladder cancer progression and chemosensitivity. Transwell, MTT, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of CAF-derived exosomes on bladder cancer cell metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemosensitivity. A dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to evaluate the targeting relationship between miR-148b-3p and PTEN. Gain- and loss- of function assays were conducted to explore the roles of miR-148b-3p and PTEN in the behavior of bladder cancer cells. The role of PTEN in the metastasis, EMT and chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells was assessed both in vivo and in vitro. We found that CAF-derived exosomes promoted the metastasis, EMT and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. We also found that CAF-derived exosomes could directly transport miR-148b-3p into bladder cancer cells. In a xenograft mouse model we found that CAF-derived exosomes increased miR-148b-3p expression levels and promoted tumor proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance. PTEN was validated as a target of miR-148b-3p. Concordantly, we found that PTEN overexpression inhibited EMT, metastasis and chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells, reversing the tumor promoting effects of miR-148b-3p via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our results suggest that miR-148b-3p downregulation in CAF-derived exosomes, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promoting PTEN expression, may offer potential opportunities for bladder cancer treatment."

In particular, the presence of FZD10 and FZD10-mRNA in exosomes extracted from culture medium of the untreated colorectal, gastric, hepatic, and cholangio cancer cell lines, was detected. A substantial reduction in the FZD10 and FZD10-mRNA level was achieved in FZD10-mRNA silenced cells and in their corresponding exosomes.

Herein, we aimed to understand the role (on a molecular basis) patient-derived EVs play in modulating cancer stemness and tumorigenesis in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). EVs from patient sera were isolated, quantified and characterized. The EVs were vigorously tested, both in vitro and in vivo, through various functional assays. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify the functional components of EVs. The presence and level of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) in circulating EVs and tumor and non-tumorous tissues of patients with HCC were determined by ELISA, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. The functional role and underlying mechanism of EVs with enhanced pIgR expression were elucidated. Blockade of EV-pIgR with neutralizing antibody was performed in nude mice implanted with patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs). Circulating EVs from patients with late-stage HCC (L-HCC) had significantly elevated pIgR expression compared to the EVs released by control individuals. The augmenting effect of L-HCC-EVs on cancer stemness and tumorigenesis was hindered by an anti-pIgR antibody. EVs enriched with pIgR consistently promoted cancer stemness and cancerous phenotypes in recipient cells. Mechanistically, EV-pIgR-induced cancer aggressiveness was abrogated by Akt and β-catenin inhibitors, confirming that the role of EV-pIgR depends on the activation of the PDK1/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling axis. Furthermore, an anti-pIgR neutralizing antibody attenuated tumor growth in mice implanted with PDTXs. This study illustrates a previously unknown role of EV-pIgR in regulating cancer stemness and aggressiveness: EV-pIgR activates PDK1/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling cascades. The blockade of the intercellular communication mediated by EV-pIgR in the tumor microenvironment may provide a new therapeutic strategy for patients with cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1 million patients will die from liver cancer, mostly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in 2030. Understanding the underlying mechanism by which HCC acquires aggressive attributes is crucial to improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Herein, we demonstrated that nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles released by tumors promote cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. Within these oncogenic vesicles, we identified a key component that functions as a potent modulator of cancer aggressiveness. By inhibiting this functional component of EVs using a neutralizing antibody, tumor growth was profoundly attenuated in mice.

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for English-language studies using terms related to exosomes/extracellular vesicles, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), lipid metabolism, and drug resistance/chemoresistance, and integrated the literature qualitatively. Evidence indicates that exosomes reprogram tumor and stromal metabolism by delivering enzymes and non-coding RNAs that boost glycolysis and dampen OXPHOS, activate cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and modulate ferroptosis. They stimulate angiogenesis (e.g., via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/Wnt pathways) and promote immune escape through programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and macrophage reprogramming. Exosomal integrins and proteases contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), organotropism, and pre-metastatic niche formation. Critically, exosomes propagate chemoresistance by exporting drugs and spreading determinants-including P-gp/BCRP/MRP-1, anti-apoptotic proteins, and regulatory RNAs-to previously sensitive cells; adipose-derived vesicles and lipid cargos further reinforce metabolic plasticity and therapy resistance. Given their stability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, exosomes are promising vectors for targeted delivery; engineered vesicles can enhance chemotherapy responsiveness and counteract resistance, particularly alongside immunotherapy. In summary, interventions that disrupt exosome biogenesis, cargo loading, or uptake-paired with engineered exosomes for precision delivery-could mitigate drug resistance, metastasis, and immune evasion and advance more effective cancer treatment."

The ""oncogenic"" immune cells are mainly represented by B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Among immune cells, macrophages exhibit a more plastic and adaptable phenotype due to their different subpopulations, which are characterized by both immunosuppressive and inflammatory phenotypes. Specifically, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) create an immunosuppressive milieu through the production of a plethora of paracrine factors (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, CCL1, CCL18) promoting the acquisition by CSCs of a stem-like, invasive and metastatic phenotype. TAMs have demonstrated the ability to communicate with CSCs via direct ligand/receptor (such as CD90/CD11b, LSECtin/BTN3A3, EPHA4/Ephrin) interaction. On the other hand, CSCs exhibited their capacity to influence immune cells, creating a favorable microenvironment for cancer progression.

Exosomes contain different kinds of biologically active substances such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, miRNAs, and signaling molecules. These molecules are widely involved in cell-cell communication, cell signal transmission, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the positive effects exerted by ADSCs-Exo after hepatic ischemia-reperfusion with partial resection injury in rats. In this study, we found that the post-operative tail vein injection of ADSCs-Exo could effectively inhibit the expression of pyroptosis-related factors such as NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, and promote the expression of regeneration-related factors such as Cyclin D1 and VEGF. Moreover, we found that the above cellular activities were associated with the NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. According to the results, ADSCs and ADSCs-Exo can reduce pyroptosis in the injured liver and promote the expression of those factors related to liver regeneration, while they can inhibit the NF-κB pathway and activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, although adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) transplantation can reduce liver injury, it leads to a significant increase in the pyroptosis-related protein GSDMD-N expression. In conclusion, our study shows that ADSCs-Exo has unique advantages and significance as a cell-free therapy to replace stem cells and still has a broad research prospect in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of liver injuries."

In this study, ADMSC-derived exosomes (ADMSCs-ex) were administrated into the rats subjected to I/R injury and H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Consequently, administration of ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarction, accompanied with a decrease in serum levels of creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Simultaneously, ADMSCs-ex dramatically antagonized I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis, along with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax, and inhibition of Caspase 3 activity in rat myocardium. Similarly, ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced cell apoptosis and the expression of Bax, but markedly increased cell viability and the expression of Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 under H/R. Furthermore, ADMSCs-ex observably induced the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by attenuating I/R- and H/R-induced inhibition of Wnt3a, p-GSK-3β (Ser9), and β-catenin expression. Importantly, treatment with Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor XAV939 partly neutralized ADMSC-ex-induced antiapoptotic and prosurvival effects in H9c2 cells.

To test this hypothesis, we simulated a chronic congestive cardiopulmonary heart failure (CHF) phenotype by creating an aorta-vena cava fistula (AVF) in the C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice. Briefly, there are four ways to create an experimental CHF: (1) myocardial infarction (MI), which is basically ligating the coronary artery by instrumenting and injuring the heart; (2) trans-aortic constriction (TAC) method, which mimics the systematic hypertension, but again constricts the aorta on top of the heart and, in fact, exposes the heart; (3) acquired CHF condition, promoted by dietary factors, diabetes, salt, diet, etc., but is multifactorial in nature; and finally, (4) the AVF, which remains the only one wherein AVF is created ~1 cm below the kidneys in which the aorta and vena cava share the common middle-wall. By creating the AVF fistula, the red blood contents enter the vena cava without an injury to the cardiac tissue. This model mimics or simulates the CHF phenotype, for example, during aging wherein with advancing age, the preload volume keeps increasing beyond the level that the aging heart can pump out due to the weakened cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, this procedure also involves the right ventricle to lung to left ventricle flow, thus creating an ideal condition for congestion. The heart in AVF transitions from preserved to reduced EF (i.e., HFpEF to HFrEF). In fact, there are more models of volume overload, such as the pacing-induced and mitral valve regurgitation, but these are also injurious models in nature. Our laboratory is one of the first laboratories to create and study the AVF phenotype in the animals. The RDN was created by treating the cleaned bilateral renal artery. After 6 weeks, blood, heart, and renal samples were analyzed for exosome, cardiac regeneration markers, and the renal cortex proteinases. Cardiac function was analyzed by echocardiogram (ECHO) procedure. The fibrosis was analyzed with a trichrome staining method. The results suggested that there was a robust increase in the exosomes' level in AVF blood, suggesting a compensatory systemic response during AVF-CHF. During AVF, there was no change in the cardiac eNOS, Wnt1, or β-catenin; however, during RDN, there were robust increases in the levels of eNOS, Wnt1, and β-catenin compared to the sham group. As expected in HFpEF, there was perivascular fibrosis, hypertrophy, and pEF. Interestingly, increased levels of eNOS suggested that despite fibrosis, the NO generation was higher and that it most likely contributed to pEF during HF. The RDN intervention revealed an increase in renal cortical caspase 8 and a decrease in caspase 9. Since caspase 8 is protective and caspase 9 is apoptotic, we suggest that RDN protects against the renal stress and apoptosis. It should be noted that others have demonstrated a role of vascular endothelium in preserving the ejection by cell therapy intervention. In the light of foregoing evidence, our findings also suggest that RDN is cardioprotective during HFpEF via preservation of the eNOS and accompanied endocardial-endothelial function."

In recent years, exosomes have attracted much attention for their important roles in immune response, antigen presentation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and tumor invasion. Meanwhile, exosomes have been shown to have great potential in the treatment of I/R injury in organs. The study of the exosome-mediated signaling pathway can not only help to reveal the mechanism behind exosomes promoting reperfusion injury recovery, but also provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of exosomes. Here, we review the research progress in utilizing various exosomes from different cell types to promote the healing of I/R injury, focusing on the classical signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, Nrf2, PTEN, Wnt, MAPK, toll-like receptor, and AMPK.

The interaction between the vascular and nervous systems is essential for the development of a healthy brain, especially since neurons are exceptionally dependent on nutrients carried by the blood. Therefore, anomalies in the delicate balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors and the consequences of disrupted angiogenesis, such as misalignment, vascular leakage and disturbed blood flow, are responsible for neurodegeneration. The implications of altered non-productive angiogenesis in Alzheimer's disease due to dysregulated Delta-Notch and VEGF signaling are further explored.

Nevertheless, levels of 3 miRNAs in plasma or plasma EVs of participants who were amyloid positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) positive were significantly higher than those from the Aβ-PET negative participants (p < .05). The selected miRNAs induced Aβ production (p < .05) through activation of β-cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (CTF-β; p < .01), and downregulated their target genes (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and Jagged canonical notch ligand 1; p < .05), which was further supported by pathway enrichment analysis of target genes of the miRNAs. In conclusion, despite of the limited diagnostic utility of selected miRNAs as plasma or plasma EV biomarkers, the discovered miRNAs may play a role in amyloidogenesis during AD onset and progression."

Here we report that ARMMs contain active NOTCH receptors and mediate a non-canonical intercellular NOTCH signaling. We identify over 100 proteins that are significantly enriched in ARMMs, including ARRDC1, TSG101 and multiple ESCRT complex proteins. About a third of ARMMs-enriched proteins are plasma membrane proteins, including the NOTCH2 receptor. The incorporation of NOTCH2 into ARMMs is facilitated by the ITCH E3 ligase and the metalloprotease ADAM10, both of which are also secreted into ARMMs. NOTCH2 in ARMMs can be delivered into recipient cells, and upon activation by γ-secretase cleavage, induces NOTCH-specific gene expression. Together, our findings reveal a role for ARMMs in a novel NOTCH signaling pathway that acts in distance and is independent of direct cell-cell contact.ARMMs are extracellular vesicles that bud directly at the plasma membrane; their function is poorly understood. Here the authors purify and carryout a proteomics analysis of the protein components of ARMMs, and show that NOTCH receptors are recruited into ARMMs and can be transferred to recipient cells to mediate NOTCH signaling."

Current treatment options for MS are limited in efficacy, generally linked to adverse side effects, and do not offer a cure. Stem cell therapies have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for MS, potentially promoting remyelination, exerting immunomodulatory effects and protecting against neurodegeneration. Therefore, this review article focussed on the potential of nano-engineering in stem cells as a therapeutic approach for MS, focusing on the synergistic effects of combining stem cell biology with nanotechnology to stimulate the proliferation of oligodendrocytes (OLs) from neural stem cells and OL precursor cells, by manipulating neural signalling pathways-PDGF, BMP, Wnt, Notch and their essential genes such as Sox, bHLH, Nkx. Here we discuss the pathophysiology of MS, the use of various types of stem cells in MS treatment and their mechanisms of action. In the context of nanotechnology, we present an overview of its applications in the medical and research field and discuss different methods and materials used to nano-engineer stem cells, including surface modification, biomaterials and scaffolds, and nanoparticle-based delivery systems. We further elaborate on nano-engineered stem cell techniques, such as nano script, nano-exosome hybrid, nano-topography and their potentials in MS. The article also highlights enhanced homing, engraftment, and survival of nano-engineered stem cells, targeted and controlled release of therapeutic agents, and immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects with their challenges and limitations. This visual illustration depicts the process of utilizing nano-engineering in stem cells and exosomes for the purpose of delivering more accurate and improved treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This approach targets specifically the creation of oligodendrocytes, the breakdown of which is the primary pathological factor in MS."

MSC exosomes represent a promising opportunity to develop novel cell-free therapy approaches. In this study, exosomes from nasal olfactory mucosa MSCs (OM-MSCs) were extracted and purified using ultracentrifugation, resulting in exosome diameters of 40-130 nm. Similar to other exosomes, OM-MSC exosomes were CD63- and CD81-positive and calnexin-negative. Functionally, OM-MSC exosomes promoted human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) proliferation and migration. The present study analyzed the OM-MSC exosome paracrine proteome. A total of 304 exosome-associated proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS, including plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE 1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein family members (IGFBP 4 and 5), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2 (NOTCH 2), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and heat shock protein HSP90-beta (HSP90AB1).

A central mechanism of its systemic impact is the release of bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs), which function as efficient transporters of virulence factors that can trigger pathological processes in distal tissues and organs. This study explores the role of P. gingivalis-derived EVs in systemic bone loss and their effects on neural function. Intraperitoneal administration in mice revealed EV accumulation in both brain tissue and long bones. Further analysis reveals that P. gingivalis EVs impair neural function in mice, as evidenced by elevated neurofilament light chain (NF-L) levels in the blood and cognitive deficits in behavioral assessments. Notably, the cholinergic nerve in the femur has been affected, with a reduction in acetylcholine (ACh) expression. ACh typically inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by P. gingivalis EVs; however, P. gingivalis EVs counteract this protective effect by suppressing ACh secretion through inhibiting Cyp4f40, a cytochrome P450 enzyme. These findings underscore the critical role of P. gingivalis EVs in the development of systemic bone loss and neurodegeneration, offering new insights into potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate the harmful effects of periodontal pathogens on bone and neurological health."

Cores of cerebellar vermis, including cortex and underlying WM from adult human postmortem AUD and control brains, were processed for RNA and protein analyses using duplex and multiplex panels. AUD cerebellar WM had significant alterations in immature and mature oligodendrocyte protein and mRNA expression, and reduced expression of hepatocyte growth factor, Akt and GSK-3β signaling molecules, and Notch pathway activation. Moreover, the only significant AUD-related alteration in cerebellar cytokine/chemokine expression was reduced IL-16 immunoreactivity. Human AUD WM degeneration is associated with oligodendrocyte dysfunction, which mechanistically could be mediated by impairments in insulin/IGF signaling through Akt/GSK-3β or Notch pathway activation.

Cells from both the peripheral and central immune systems significantly impact the development of cerebral small vessel disease. By analyzing the effects of different immune cells on brain dysfunction associated with this disease, we aim to explore the various mechanisms through which autoimmune and acquired immune cells in peripheral circulation and the central nervous system contribute to disease development. Additionally, we seek to identify potential therapeutic modalities targeting these immune cells. In innate immunity, treatment targeting different monocyte loci includes four main modalities: cytokines (CSF1R, MIF, P2X7, CX3CR1, and CCL2), signaling pathways (DAP12/TREM, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin), tissue engineering (mitochondrial transplantation and exosomes), and traditional Chinese medicines. Treatment targeting different dendritic cell loci encompasses two modalities: signaling pathway (cGAS/STING/NF-κB) and tissue engineering (tolerogenic dendritic cells and engineered probiotics). For natural killer cells, treatment targeting different loci includes two modalities: tissue engineering (natural killer cell-based immunotherapies) and traditional Chinese medicines (Tongxinluo capsule). In adaptive immunity, treatment targeting different T cell loci includes four modalities: cytokines (S1PR and RXR), signaling pathway (Nrf2/GPX4 and Notch-ITGB1), tissue engineering (elimination of senescent T cells, monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta protofibrils, nanovaccines, and nanomedicines), and traditional Chinese medicines (traditional herbal remedies and microneedle therapy). Treatment targeting different B cell loci includes three modalities: monoclonal antibodies (targeting CD49d and CD20), purine glycoside analogs (Cladribine), and plasma exchange. This review explores the relationship between nerve regeneration, immune cells, and cerebral small vessel disease. The disease is characterized by the crucial role played by signaling and interactions between immune cells and components of the neurovascular unit, which is a functional complex composed of neurons, glial cells, and microvessels that regulate inflammatory responses and tissue repair. The central nervous system lacks intrinsic regenerative capacity, and currently, there is no effective method to fully restore its function. The primary focus of current research is on utilizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to create environments that facilitate cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Hydrogels, induced pluripotent stem cells, exosomes, regulatory T cell transplants, and gene modification are key areas of focus in neural regeneration research. In the future, immune rejuvenation and other emerging therapies may offer potential treatment strategies for cerebral small vessel disease. This review analyzes the functions of various immune cells in cerebral small vessel disease, explores the relationship between nerve regeneration and these immune cells, and discusses potential therapeutic avenues that target immune cells for future treatments and neural regeneration related to cerebral small vessel disease."

The biological activities of CSCs are regulated by several pluripotent transcription factors, such as OCT4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, and MYC. In addition, many intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt, NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), Notch, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin), TGF (transforming growth factor)/SMAD, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), as well as extracellular factors, such as vascular niches, hypoxia, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, have been shown to be very important regulators of CSCs.

This transformation plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and self-renewal, and exacerbates resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy. EMT can be initiated and promoted by deregulated oncogenic signaling pathways, hypoxia, and cells in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a loss-of-epithelial cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion, and enhanced invasive/migratory properties. Numerous transcriptional regulators, such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB1/ZEB2 induce EMT through the downregulation of epithelial markers and gain-of-expression of the mesenchymal markers. Additionally, signaling cascades such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, Sonic hedgehog, nuclear factor kappa B, receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Hippo, and transforming growth factor-β pathways regulate EMT whereas they are often deregulated in cancers leading to aberrant EMT. Furthermore, noncoding RNAs, tumor-derived exosomes, and epigenetic alterations are also involved in the modulation of EMT. Therefore, the regulation of EMT is a vital strategy to control the aggressive metastatic characteristics of tumor cells. Despite the vast amount of preclinical data on EMT in cancer progression, there is a lack of clinical translation at the therapeutic level. In this review, we have discussed thoroughly the role of the aforementioned transcription factors, noncoding RNAs (microRNAs, long noncoding RNA, circular RNA), signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, and tumor-derived exosomes in the regulation of EMT in cancers. We have also emphasized the contribution of EMT to drug resistance and possible therapeutic interventions using plant-derived natural products, their semi-synthetic derivatives, and nano-formulations that are described as promising EMT blockers."

Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms are involved in cellular metabolic memory and can determine one's predisposition to being overweight. Low-grade chronic inflammation, a well-established characteristic of obesity, is a central component of tumor development and progression. Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA), which enhance inflammation- and metastasis-related gene sets within the cancer microenvironment, have pro-tumoral effects. Adipose tissue is a major source of the exosomal micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), which modulate pathways involved in the development of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. Owing to their composition of cargo, exosomes can activate receptors at the target cell or transfer molecules to the target cells and thereby change the phenotype of these cells. Exosomes that are released into the extracellular environment are internalized with their cargo by neighboring cells. The tumor-secreted exosomes promote organ-specific metastasis of tumor cells that normally lack the capacity to metastasize to a specific organ. Therefore, the communication between neighboring cells via exosomes is defined as the ""next-cell hypothesis."" The reciprocal interaction between the adipocyte and tumor cell is realized through the adipocyte-derived exosomal miRNAs and tumor cell-derived oncogenic miRNAs. The cargo molecules of adipocyte-derived exosomes are important messengers for intercellular communication involved in metabolic responses and have very specific signatures that direct the metabolic activity of target cells. RNA-induced silencing regulates gene expression through various mechanisms. Destabilization of DICER enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), is an important checkpoint in cancer development and progression. Interestingly, adipose tissue in obesity and tumors share similar pathogenic features, and the local hypoxia progress in both. While hypoxia in obesity leads to the adipocyte dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, in obesity-related cancer cases, it is associated with worsened prognosis, increased metastatic potential, and resistance to chemotherapy.

Coimmunoprecipitation and molecular docking were performed to explore the interactions between CTGF and Notch1. A high CAF abundance is associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. EVs from CAFs significantly enhanced the proliferative and invasive abilities of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was found to be highly upregulated in CAF-derived EVs, and CTGF knockdown in CAF-derived EVs attenuated their tumor-promoting capacities. Mechanistically, CTGF derived from CAF-EVs activated the Notch1/Snail1 signaling pathway in recipient cells via interaction with the Notch1 receptor, enhancing HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, high CTGF expression was significantly correlated with poor clinicopathological features in HCC patients. Our findings revealed that CTGF derived from CAF-EVs promoted the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells via activation of the Notch1/Snail1 pathway, highlighting CTGF derived from CAF-EVs as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC."

EXOs, with a diameter of approximately 100 nm, have a simple structure but diverse functions, and can affect the development of breast cancer through signal transduction and molecular transfer, etc. Angiogenesis provides nutrients for the growth and metastasis of breast cancer and is a crucial part of tumor progression. The mechanism of tumor angiogenesis is complex. The VEGF/VEGFR pathway promotes angiogenesis by regulating the activities of ECs. Hypoxia, a common feature in the tumor microenvironment, as a key regulator, can affect angiogenesis in multiple aspects such as the transfer of miRNAs in EXOs, protein transport, extracellular matrix regulation, and metabolic adaptation. The Notch pathway has a bidirectional regulatory role in breast cancer angiogenesis, and different molecules can promote or inhibit angiogenesis. EXOs secreted by breast cancer cells are rich in angiogenic factors. Components such as proteins and nucleic acids in EXOs can affect the functions and behaviors of vascular ECs, thereby influencing breast cancer angiogenesis. Research on the mechanisms of EXOs in breast cancer angiogenesis is of great significance for tumor treatment. EXOs are expected to become biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis/prognosis. This research provides potential targets for in-depth understanding of the biological characteristics of breast cancer and the development of new treatment strategies."

It is well known that metastasis establishment, cell survival, and progression are affected by tumour-host cell interactions where changes in the host cellular compartments likely play an important role. In this context, miRNAs transferred by tumour derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have previously been shown to create a favourable tumour microenvironment. Here, we show that miR-146a-5p is highly expressed in human melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) EVs, both in MBM cell lines as well as in biopsies, thereby modulating the brain metastatic niche. Mechanistically, miR-146a-5p was transferred to astrocytes via EV delivery and inhibited NUMB in the Notch signalling pathway. This resulted in activation of tumour-promoting cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL1). Brain metastases were significantly reduced following miR-146a-5p knockdown. Corroborating these findings, miR-146a-5p inhibition led to a reduction of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL1 in astrocytes. Following molecular docking analysis, deserpidine was identified as a functional miR-146a-5p inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight the pro-metastatic function of miR-146a-5p in EVs and identifies deserpidine for targeted adjuvant treatment."

The aggressive behavior of CSCs is guided by several intracellular signaling pathways such as WNT, NF-kappa-B, NOTCH, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT, PI3K/AKT1/MTOR, TGF/SMAD, PPAR and MAPK kinases, as well as extracellular vesicles such as exosomes, and extracellular signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, pro-angiogenetic and growth factors, which finely regulate CSC phenotype. In this scenario, tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key player in the establishment of a permissive tumor niche, where CSCs engage in intricate communications with diverse immune cells. The ""oncogenic"" immune cells are mainly represented by B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Among immune cells, macrophages exhibit a more plastic and adaptable phenotype due to their different subpopulations, which are characterized by both immunosuppressive and inflammatory phenotypes. Specifically, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) create an immunosuppressive milieu through the production of a plethora of paracrine factors (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, CCL1, CCL18) promoting the acquisition by CSCs of a stem-like, invasive and metastatic phenotype. TAMs have demonstrated the ability to communicate with CSCs via direct ligand/receptor (such as CD90/CD11b, LSECtin/BTN3A3, EPHA4/Ephrin) interaction. On the other hand, CSCs exhibited their capacity to influence immune cells, creating a favorable microenvironment for cancer progression. Interestingly, the bidirectional influence of CSCs and TME leads to an epigenetic reprogramming which sustains malignant transformation. Nowadays, the integration of biological and computational data obtained by cutting-edge technologies (single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, trajectory analysis) has significantly improved the comprehension of the biunivocal multicellular dialogue, providing a comprehensive view of the heterogeneity and dynamics of CSCs, and uncovering alternative mechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, the combination of biology and computational data will lead to the development of innovative target therapies dampening CSC-TME interaction. Here, we aim to elucidate the most recent insights on CSCs biology and their complex interactions with TME immune cells, specifically TAMs, tracing an exhaustive scenario from the primary tumor to metastasis formation."

However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the initiation of tumor cell dissemination and metastasis in PTCs has rarely been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in distant metastatic PTCs. The most relevant circulating exosomal miRNA to distant metastatic PTCs were verified between distant metastatic PTCs and nondistant metastatic PTCs by miRNA microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The parental and recipient cells of that circulating exosomal miRNA were then explored. In vitro and in vivo experiments were further performed to elucidate the function and potential mechanisms of circulating exosomal miRNAs that contribute to the development of distant metastases. We determined that PTC-derived exosomal miR-519e-5p was significantly upregulated in the circulatory system in distant metastatic PTCs. Further tests demonstrated that PTC cells can acquire a more malignant phenotype via hnRNPA2B1-mediated sorting of tumor suppressor miR-519e-5p into exosomes to activate Wnt signaling pathway via upregulating PLAGL2. Furthermore, miR-519e-5p included in PTC-derived exosomes can be transferred to recipient CD8+ T cells and aid in tumor immune escape in distant organs through inhibiting Notch signaling pathway by downregulating NOTCH2. Our findings highlight the dual role of PTC-derived exosomal miR-519e-5p in distant metastasis, which may improve our understanding of exosome-mediated distant metastatic mechanisms."

Mechanistically, ASPH activates Notch cascade through direct physical interactions with Notch1/JAGs and ADAMs. The ASPH-Notch axis enables prometastatic secretome trafficking via exosomes, subsequently initiates MMPs mediated ECM degradation/remodeling as an effector for invasiveness. Consequently, ASPH fosters primary tumor development and pulmonary metastasis in PDX models, which was blocked by a newly developed small molecule inhibitor (SMI) specifically against ASPH's β-hydroxylase activity. Clinically, ASPH is silenced in normal pancreas, progressively upregulated from pre-malignant lesions to invasive/advanced stage PDAC. Relatively high levels of ASPH-Notch network components independently/jointly predict curtailed overall survival (OS) in PDAC patients (log-rank test, Ps < 0.001; Cox proportional hazards regression, P < 0.001).

Evidence has shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs), a sub-population of cells that share many common characteristics with somatic stem cells (SSCs), contribute to this therapeutic failure. The most critical properties of CSCs are their self-renewal ability and their capacity for differentiation into heterogeneous populations of cancer cells. Although CSCs only constitute a low percentage of the total tumor mass, these cells can regrow the tumor mass on their own. Initially identified in leukemia, CSCs have subsequently been found in cancers of the breast, the colon, the pancreas, and the brain. Common genetic and phenotypic features found in both SSCs and CSCs, including upregulated signaling pathways such as Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, and TGF-β. These pathways play fundamental roles in the development as well as in the control of cell survival and cell fate and are relevant to therapeutic targeting of CSCs. The differences in the expression of membrane proteins and exosome-delivered microRNAs between SSCs and CSCs are also important to specifically target the stem cells of the cancer.

Primary CAFs were isolated from high-grade BC tissues (Grade III) and characterized (α-SMA⁺/CD34⁻/pan-CK⁻), with normal fibroblasts (NFs) from reduction mammoplasty as controls. Hypoxic CAF-derived exosomal circSTAT3 stability was validated using RNase R resistance and actinomycin D assays. Exosomes were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and marker profiling (CD63⁺/TSG101⁺/Alix⁺, calnexin⁻). Functional effects of hypoxic CAF exosomes on TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, SUM159) were assessed through proliferation/migration assays, stemness/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker analysis, and siRNA-mediated circSTAT3 knockdown. Mechanistic studies employed luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). Chemoresistance was evaluated by cisplatin half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀). In vivo tumor growth and stemness enrichment were analyzed in xenografts. Clinical validation used BC tissues (n = 60) and plasma exosomes from BC patients (n = 40) versus healthy controls (n = 25). Hypoxic CAF-derived exosomes efficiently transferred circSTAT3 to TNBC cells, promoting proliferation, migration, EMT, and stemness marker expression. SiRNA-mediated circSTAT3 knockdown reversed these effects. Mechanistically, circSTAT3 acted as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), sponging miR-671-5p to derepress NOTCH1. Hypoxic CAF exosomes increased cisplatin IC₅₀ in TNBC cells, while circSTAT3 depletion restored chemosensitivity. In vivo, hypoxic CAF exosomes accelerated tumor growth, enriched CD44⁺/NOTCH1⁺ populations, and elevated circulating exosomal circSTAT3. Clinically, circSTAT3 was significantly upregulated in advanced BC tissues (p < 0.01) and patient plasma exosomes (p < 0.01), correlating with lymph node metastasis. This study identifies a hypoxia-driven feedforward loop wherein CAF-derived exosomal circSTAT3 promotes TNBC stemness and chemoresistance via miR-671-5p/NOTCH1 signaling. CircSTAT3 redefines stromal-tumor crosstalk as a circRNA-driven process and serves as both a circulating non-invasive biomarker and a promising therapeutic target to disrupt stromal-mediated resistance in aggressive TNBC."

Western blot, MTT, immunofluorescence, luciferase reporter, co-immunoprecipitation, 2D/3-D invasion, tube formation, mammosphere formation, immunohistochemistry and newly developed in vitro metastasis were applied. Through physical interactions with Notch receptors, ligands (JAGs) and regulators (ADAM10/17), ASPH activates Notch cascade to provide raw materials (especially MMPs/ADAMs) for synthesis/release of pro-metastatic exosomes. Exosomes orchestrate EMT, 2-D/3-D invasion, stemness, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. Small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of ASPH's β-hydroxylase specifically/efficiently abrogated in vitro metastasis, which mimics basement membrane invasion at primary site, intravasation/extravasation (transendothelial migration), and colonization/outgrowth at distant sites. Multiple organ-metastases in orthotopic and tail vein injection murine models were substantially blocked by a specific SMI. ASPH is silenced in normal adult breast, upregulated from in situ malignancies to highly expressed in invasive/advanced ductal carcinoma. Moderate-high expression of ASPH confers more aggressive molecular subtypes (TNBC or Her2 amplified), early recurrence/progression and devastating outcome (reduced overall/disease-free survival) of breast cancer. Expression profiling of Notch signaling components positively correlates with ASPH expression in breast cancer patients, confirming that ASPH-Notch axis acts functionally in breast tumorigenesis.

We show that triggering of stromal NOTCH-MYC by breast cancer cells results in a POL3-driven increase in RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA normally shielded by RNA binding proteins SRP9/14. This increase in RN7SL1 alters its stoichiometry with SRP9/14 and generates unshielded RN7SL1 in stromal exosomes.

The pathogenesis of osteolytic bone metastasis depends on cross-communications between tumor cells and various stromal cells residing in the bone microenvironment. Several growth factor signaling pathways, secreted micro RNAs (miRNAs) and exosomes are functional mediators of tumor-stromal interactions in bone metastasis. We developed a functional genomic approach to systemically identified molecular pathways utilized by breast cancer cells to engage the bone stroma in order to generate osteolytic bone metastasis. We showed that elevated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) in disseminated breast tumor cells mediates the recruitment of pre-osteoclasts and promotes their differentiation to mature osteoclasts during the bone metastasis formation. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is released from bone matrix upon bone destruction, and signals to breast cancer to further enhance their malignancy in developing bone metastasis. We furthered identified Jagged1 as a TGF-β target genes in tumor cells that engaged bone stromal cells through the activation of Notch signaling to provide a positive feedback to promote tumor growth and to activate osteoclast differentiation. Substantially change in miRNA expression was observed in osteoclasts during their differentiation and maturation, which can be exploited as circulating biomarkers of emerging bone metastasis and therapeutic targets for the treatment of bone metastasis.

Indeed, exosomal miRNAs contribute to several aspects of glioma, such as development, occurrence, metastasis, and immune evasion. Additionally, exosomal miRNAs play a key role in cellular functions and glioma pathogenesis by regulating numerous pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, PTEN/PI3K/Akt, EGFR/MAPK, notch signaling, and NF-κB. Notably, exosomal miRNAs are recognized to have promising potential in clinical applications; in fact, exosomal miRNAs are emerging biomarkers for glioma diagnosis and prognosis and are additionally considered as putative therapeutic candidates by inhibiting tumor progression, occurrence, and metastasis.

In tumor cells, too, cld7 exists in two stages. Only GEM-located cld7, which is palmitoylated, promotes metastasis. Searching for the underlying mechanism(s) revealed the following.The metastatic capacity of the rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line ASML is lost by a knockdown (kd) of cld7 and is not regained by rescuing cld7 with a mutated palmitoylation site (cld7mPalm). ASML-cld7kd and ASML-cld7mPalm cells show reduced motility and invasiveness. This is due to cld7, but not cld7mPalm associating with α6β4, ezrin, uPAR and MMP14, which jointly support motility and invasion. Palmitoylated cld7 also is engaged in drug resistance by repressing Pten, allowing activation of the antiapoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway. An association of cld7mPalm with the major Pten phosphorylating kinases does not restore apoptosis resistance as phosphorylated Pten is not guided towards GEM to compete with non-phosphorylated Pten. The pathway whereby palmitoylated cld7 supports expression of several EMT genes and nuclear translocation of EMT transcription factors remains to be unraveled. An association with Notch, reduced in ASML-cld7mPalm cells, might be the starting point. Finally, GEM-located, palmitoylated cld7 associates with several components of vesicle transport machineries engaged in exosome biogenesis.Taken together, prerequisites for cld7 acting as a cancer-initiating cell marker are GEM location and palmitoylation, which support a multitude of associations and integration into exosomes. The latter suggests palmitoylated cld7 contributing to message transfer via exosomes."

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), major cell components in the TME, exert significant effects on malignant behaviors of various cancers. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer with a high metastatic potential and poorer prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which CAFs promote TNBC development has not been sufficiently studied. The study aims to elucidate how CAFs promote TNBC aggressiveness by delivering protein-coding circMIB1 to activate MIB1/DLL4/Notch pathway, and provide a potential clinical biomarker for TNBC management. The oncogenic exosomal circMIB1 with protein-coding potential was identified through high-throughput RNA sequencing and ribosome nascent-chain complex sequencing (RNC-seq). The enrichment of circMIB1 in CAFs was confirmed using in situ hybridization (ISH) and qRT-PCR. The protein-coding capacity of circMIB1 was validated based on the polysome profiling, and luciferase assays. Functional roles of circMIB1 were explored using in vitro and in vivo models, while the underlying mechanism was dissected via co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and western blotting. CAF-secreted exosomal circMIB1 promoted TNBC metastasis and stemness by translating a functional peptide, MIB1-223aa. Mechanistically, MIB1-223aa competitively bound to the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF213, which blocked the RNF213-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of MIB1. Moreover, the stabilized MIB1 enhanced the Notch signaling via a ubiquitination-dependent activation of the ligand DLL4, thereby driving TNBC malignancy. Clinically, high expression of circMIB1 or MIB1-223aa in TNBC tissues was correlated with poor clinical prognosis, as evidenced by reduced overall survival, shortened disease-free survival, and elevated lymphatic metastasis rates. This study provides the first evidence of exosome-transmitted protein-coding circRNAs in CAF-TNBC crosstalk, offering novel insights into the TME-driven metastasis and providing promising biomarker for TNBC management."

Aberrantly expressed miRNAs in cancer, sometimes known as oncomiRNAs, have been shown to play a major role in oncogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Amplification of oncomiRNAs during cancer development correlates with the silencing of tumor suppressor genes; on the other hand, down-regulation of miRNAs has also been observed in cancer and cancer stem cells (CSCs). In both cases, miRNA regulation is inversely correlated with cancer progression. Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs are also involved in the metastatic process by either suppressing or promoting metastasis-related genes leading to the reduction or activation of cancer cell migration and invasion processes. In particular, circulating miRNAs (vesicle-encapsulated or non-encapsulated) have significant effects on tumorigenesis: membrane-particles, apoptotic bodies, and exosomes have been described as providers of a cell-to-cell communication system transporting oncogenic miRNAs from tumors to neighboring cells and distant metastatic sites. It is hypothesized that miRNAs control cancer development in a traditional manner, by regulating signaling pathways and factors. In addition, recent developments indicate a non-conventional mechanism of cancer regulation by stem cell reprograming via a regulatory network consisting of miRNAs and Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathways, all of which are involved in controlling stem cell functions of CSCs. In this review, we focus on the role of miRNAs in the Notch-pathway and how they regulate CSC self-renewal, differentiation and tumorigenesis by direct/indirect targeting of the Notch-pathway."

Here, we observed that MSC-EVs efficiently passed through the BBB and selectively accumulated in injured brain regions in ischemic stroke model mice in real time using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), which exhibit better tracking ability than the commercially available tracer DiR. Moreover, tPA administration promoted the homing of MSC-EVs to the ischemic brain and increased the uptake of MSC-EVs by astrocytes. Furthermore, the accumulated MSC-EVs attenuated the tPA-induced disruption of BBB integrity and alleviated hemorrhage by inhibiting astrocyte activation and inflammation. Mechanistically, miR-125b-5p delivered by MSC-EVs played an indispensable role in maintaining BBB integrity by targeting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibiting nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in astrocytes. This study provides a noninvasive method for real-time tracking of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain after tPA treatment and highlights the potential of MSC-EVs as thrombolytic adjuvants for ischemic stroke. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although tPA thrombolysis is the most effective pharmaceutical strategy for acute ischemic stroke, its clinical application and therapeutic efficacy are challenged by tPA-induced BBB disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. Our study demonstrated that MSC-EVs can act as an attractive thrombolytic adjuvant to repair the BBB and improve thrombolysis in a mouse ischemic stroke model. Notably, by labeling MSC-EVs with AIEgens, we achieved accurate real-time imaging of MSC-EVs in the ischemic brain and therapeutic visualization. MSC-EVs inhibit astrocyte activation and associated inflammation through miR-125b-5p/TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Consequently, we revealed that MSC-EVs combined with tPA thrombolysis may be a promising approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinical setting."

In aged mouse brains, the number of infiltrating immune cells increases, and the key transcription factor associated with increased chemokine levels is nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Exosomes are potent therapeutics or drug delivery vehicles for various materials, including proteins and regulatory genes, to target cells. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes loaded with a nondegradable form of IκB (Exo-srIκB), which inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-κB to suppress age-related neuroinflammation. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that these anti-inflammatory exosomes targeted macrophages and microglia, reducing the expression of inflammation-related genes. Treatment with Exo-srIκB also suppressed the interactions between macrophages/microglia and T and B cells in the aged brain. We demonstrated that Exo-srIκB successfully alleviates neuroinflammation by primarily targeting activated macrophages and partially modulating the functions of age-related interferon-responsive microglia in the brain. Thus, our findings highlight Exo-srIκB as a potential therapeutic agent for treating age-related neuroinflammation."

Previous studies have reported that the optineurin gene (OPTN) downregulation is one of the causative genetic factors for ALS, leading to the dysfunction of optineurin (OPTN), a multifunctional protein implicated in several cellular processes. Herein, we found that conditional knockout of the Optn gene in mouse microglia leads to activation of microglia. In subsequent studies, we also found that OPTN knockdown in BV2 cells leads to the activation of BV2 cells and promotes the apoptosis of co-cultured NSC34 cells via exosomes derived from BV2 cells in vitro. In contrast, OPTN knockdown in NSC34 cells did not cause apoptosis of the NSC34 cells themselves. It was suggested that microglia activation is involved in ALS initiation and development, but the nature of microglial-neuronal interactions remained elusive, requiring further exploration. Exosomes have been proven to be essential mediators. Notably, increased miRNA-125b-5p expression was uncovered in BV2 cells with the OPTN gene silenced, their derived exosomes, as well as the cocultured NSC34 cells. Interestingly, we proved that increased miRNA-125b-5p enhanced the apoptosis of NSC34 cells. We further noted that the overexpression of miRNA-125b-5p in BV2 cells can be regulated by an NF-κB activator (LPS) or inhibitor (withaferin A). Altogether, this study showed that silencing the OPTN gene may overexpress miRNA-125b-5p levels via the classical NF-κB pathway in BV2 cells. Up-regulated miRNA-125b-5p might be transmitted from exosomes to NSC34 cells, resulting in NSC34 cells apoptosis. Microglial-neuronal interactions mediated by exosomes were the crucial mechanism of OPTN gene downregulation leading to ALS, and this conclusion had been verified in cell models."

Dysregulation of Optn has been linked to neurodegenerative, autoimmune and bone diseases. Optn shares a high degree of homology with NEMO, but is not part of the same high-molecular weight complex containing IKKα and IKKβ. Despite its homology with NEMO and the fact that it has been the subject of extensive study in several cell types, there are no published studies addressing the role of Optn during T cell activation. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Optn down-regulates TCR-induced NF-κB activation and TNF-α production, in a manner dependent on ubiquitin-binding. Conversely, knock-down of Optn enhances NF-κB activation and the production of TNF-α. Consistent with a negative regulatory role for this protein, we observed transient loss of Optn after TCR stimulation in both cell lines and in primary murine T cells. The acute loss of Optn appears to be due to both protein degradation and exocytosis, the latter via activation-induced exosomes. This study therefore provides novel information regarding the role of Optn during TCR activation, suggesting the possible importance of Optn during inflammation and/or autoimmune diseases."

Among these, miR-146a-5p emerged as the most dysregulated and significant miRNA in ALS (P = 0.0000142, P-adj = 0.0096), particularly in extracellular vesicle-derived studies. To evaluate its diagnostic accuracy, we validated miR-146a-5p expression in serum-derived exosomes and observed a significant increase in sporadic ALS (sALS) patients (n = 22) as compared to healthy controls (n = 18). Moreover, higher levels of miR-146a-5p were strongly associated with longer survival (≥ 5 years) (P = 0.0135), with a positive correlation between miR-146a-5p expression and survival duration (P = 0.0313) in sALS patients. Further, gene set enrichment analysis of miR-146a-5p target genes highlighted critical involvement of the Immune system and NF-kappa B signaling pathways in ALS pathophysiology.

However, their roles in obesity-associated adipocyte inflammation, the NF-κB pathway and related sub-networks have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated impact of OC and OA on the activation of NF-κB and the expression of molecules associated with inflammatory and dysmetabolic responses. To this aim, fully differentiated Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes were pre-treated with OC or OA before stimulation with TNF-α. EVOO polyphenols significantly reduced the expression of genes implicated in adipocyte inflammation (IL-1β, COX-2), angiogenesis (VEGF/KDR, MMP-2), oxidative stress (NADPH oxidase), antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPX), leukocytes chemotaxis and infiltration (MCP-1, CXCL-10, MCS-F), and improved the expression of the anti-inflammatory/metabolic effector PPARγ. Accordingly, miR-155-5p, miR-34a-5p and let-7c-5p, tightly connected with the NF-κB pathway, were deregulated by TNF-α in both cells and exosomes. The miRNA modulation and NF-κB activation by TNF-α was significantly counteracted by EVOO polyphenols. Computational studies suggested a potential direct interaction between OC and NF-κB at the basis of its activity. This study demonstrates that OC and OA counteract adipocyte inflammation attenuating NF-κB activation. Therefore, these compounds could be novel dietary tools for the prevention of inflammatory diseases associated with obesity."

We found that CTXD14SkM-EVs enhanced myoblast differentiation and fusion in a cellular muscle-wasting model induced by pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Intramuscular administration of these EVs into an ALS mouse model mitigated muscle atrophy by promoting muscle regeneration, shifting macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 state, and suppressing the aberrant Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a key driver of muscle protein degradation.

However, the contribution of competitive RBP-RNA interactions responsible for RNA-sorting outcomes is still unclear, especially for predicting the EV-RNA content. We designed a reverse proteomic analysis exploiting the EV-RNA to identify intracellular protein binders in vitro. Using cells expressing a recombinant hnRNPA2B1 to normalize competitive interactions, we prioritized a network of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and purine-rich RNA sequences subsequently validated in secreted EV-RNA through short fluorescent RNA oligos. Then, we designed a GGGAG-enriched RNA probe that efficiently interacted with a full-length human hnRNPA2B1 protein. We exploited the interaction to conduct a pharmacological screening and identify inhibitors of the protein-RNA binding. Small molecules were orthogonally validated through biochemical and cell-based approaches. Selected drugs remarkably impacted secreted EV-RNAs and reduced an RNA-dependent, EV-mediated paracrine activation of NF-kB in recipient cells.

We previously reported that administration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) ameliorates diabetes-induced cognitive impairment by transferring exosomes derived from these cells into astrocytes. Here, we show that intracerebroventricularly injected BM-MSCs improve cognitive impairment in AD model mice by ameliorating astrocytic inflammation as well as synaptogenesis. Although AD model mice showed an increase in NF-κB in the hippocampus, BM-MSC-treated AD model mice did not show this increase but showed an increase in levels of microRNA (miR)-146a in the hippocampus. Intracerebroventricularly injected BM-MSCs were attached to the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle, and thus, BM-MSCs may secrete exosomes into the cerebrospinal fluid. In vitro experiments showed that exosomal miR-146a secreted from BM-MSCs was taken up into astrocytes, and an increased level of miR-146a and a decreased level of NF-κB were observed in astrocytes. Astrocytes are key cells for the formation of synapses, and thus, restoration of astrocytic function may have led to synaptogenesis and correction of cognitive impairment. The present study indicates that exosomal transfer of miR-146a is involved in the correction of cognitive impairment in AD model mice."

Innate immune activation is observed in Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. We have previously reported loss of A-to-I editing in hippocampus vasculature, but no change in cortex or cortex vasculature, associated with Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigated the status of Alu RNA A-to-I editing in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease. We used existing RNA-seq data sets and the SPRINT software package to determine levels of Alu RNA A-to-I editing in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease and control groups and compared these editing profiles to those found in both total cortex and hippocampus vasculature. We find substantial loss of Alu A-to-I editing in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease. By measuring editing patterns on a gene-by-gene basis, we determined that editing patterns in cortex extracellular vesicles resemble editing patterns in hippocampus vasculature rather than total cortex. We conclude that hippocampus vasculature unedited Alu RNAs are packaged in extracellular vesicles, travel to the cortex, deliver their cargo and stimulate innate immunity and alter other basic biological processes contributing to Alzheimer's disease progression."

Evidences indicate that ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease in which glial cells participate in both disease onset and progression. Exosomal transfer of mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) from cell-to-cell was suggested to contribute to disease dissemination. Data from our group and others showed that exosomes from activated cells contain inflammatory-related microRNAs (inflamma-miRNAs) that recapitulate the donor cell. While glia-derived exosomes and their effects in neurons have been addressed by several studies, only a few investigated the influence of motor neuron (MN)-derived exosomes in other cell function, the aim of the present study. We assessed a set of inflamma-miRs in NSC-34 MN-like cells transfected with mutant SOD1(G93A) and extended the study into their derived exosomes (mSOD1 exosomes). Then, the effects produced by mSOD1 exosomes in the activation and polarization of the recipient N9 microglial cells were investigated. Exosomes in coculture with N9 microglia and NSC-34 cells [either transfected with either wild-type (wt) human SOD1 or mutant SOD1(G93A)] showed to be transferred into N9 cells. Increased miR-124 expression was found in mSOD1 NSC-34 cells and in their derived exosomes. Incubation of mSOD1 exosomes with N9 cells determined a sustained 50% reduction in the cell phagocytic ability. It also caused a persistent NF-kB activation and an acute generation of NO, MMP-2, and MMP-9 activation, as well as upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, MHC-II, and iNOS gene expression, suggestive of induced M1 polarization. Marked elevation of IL-10, Arginase 1, TREM2, RAGE, and TLR4 mRNA levels, together with increased miR-124, miR-146a, and miR-155, at 24 h incubation, suggest the switch to mixed M1 and M2 subpopulations in the exosome-treated N9 microglial cells. Exosomes from mSOD1 NSC-34 MNs also enhanced the number of senescent-like positive N9 cells. Data suggest that miR-124 is translocated from the mSOD1 MNs to exosomes, which determine early and late phenotypic alterations in the recipient N9-microglial cells. In conclusion, modulation of the inflammatory-associated miR-124, in mSOD1 NSC-34 MNs, with potential benefits in the cargo of their exosomes may reveal a promising therapeutic strategy in halting microglia activation and associated effects in MN degeneration."

TDE signaling through TLR2 and NF-κB leads to increased glucose uptake. TDEs also stimulate elevated NOS2, which inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation resulting in increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Lactate feeds back on NF-κB, further increasing PD-L1. Analysis of metastasis-negative lymph nodes of non-small-cell lung cancer patients revealed that macrophage PD-L1 positively correlates with levels of GLUT-1 and vesicle release gene YKT6 from primary tumors. Collectively, our study provides a novel mechanism by which macrophages within a pre-metastatic niche acquire their immunosuppressive phenotype and identifies an important link among exosomes, metabolism, and metastasis."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as a novel component of the SASP and primarily mediate the tumor-promoting effect of the SASP. Of note, the potential effect of EVs released from STCs on tumor progression remains largely unknown. We collected tumor tissues from two cohorts of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to examine the expression of p16, p21, and SERPINE1 before and after anti-cancer treatment. Cohort 1 included 22 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who received neoadjuvant therapy before surgical resection. Cohort 2 included 30 patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) who received first-line irinotecan-contained treatment. CCK-8, transwell, wound-healing assay, and tumor xenograft experiments were carried out to determine the impacts of EVs released from STCs on CRC progression in vitro and in vivo. Quantitative proteomic analysis was applied to identify protein cargo inside EVs secreted from STCs. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometer identification were utilized to explore the binding partners of SERPINE1. The interaction of SERPINE1 with p65 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation, and their co-localization was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation could potently induce senescence in CRC cells in vitro and in human CRC tissues. The more significant elevation of p16 and p21 expression in patients after anti-cancer treatment displayed shorter disease-free survival (DFS) for LARC or progression-free survival (PFS) for mCRC. We observed that compared to non-STCs, STCs released an increased number of EVs enriched in SERPINE1, which further promoted the progression of recipient cancer cells. Targeting SERPINE1 with a specific inhibitor, tiplaxtinin, markedly attenuated the tumor-promoting effect of STCs-derived EVs. Additionally, the patients with greater increment of SERPINE1 expression after anti-cancer treatment had shorter DFS for LARC or PFS for mCRC. Mechanistically, SERPINE1 bound to p65, promoting its nuclear translocation and subsequently activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. We provide the in vivo evidence of the clinical prognostic implications of therapy-induced senescence. Our results revealed that STCs were responsible for CRC progression by producing large amounts of EVs enriched in SERPINE1. These findings further confirm the crucial role of therapy-induced senescence in tumor progression and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment."

The activated fibroblasts induce the pre-metastatic niche formation and promote metastatic cancer growth by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-6 and IL-8. Mechanistically, the primary CRC-derived ITGBL1-enriched EVs stimulate the TNFAIP3-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway to activate fibroblasts.

Oleanolic acid (OA) was intragastrically administered to TDEs-preconditioned mice. Bioinformatics analysis and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays were performed to identify targets of OA in fibroblasts.

OA inhibited TDEs-induced PMN formation and lung metastasis and suppressed TDEs-mediated fibroblast activation. MAPK1 and MAPK3 (ERK1/2) were the potential targets of OA. Furthermore, H-TDEs enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo, which was suppressed by OA treatment. Blocking ERK1/2 signaling with its inhibitor abated H-TDEs-induced activation of fibroblasts and PMN formation. H-TDEs-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in fibroblasts touched off the activation NF-κB p65, which was mitigated by OA. In addition, the ERK activator C16-PAF recovered the activation of ERK1/2 and NF-κB p65 in H-TDEs-stimulated MRC5 cells upon OA treatment.

KLHL21 was poorly expressed, whereas miR-660 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cells. Of note, low KLHL21 expression or high miR-660 expression was related to poor overall survival. EVs-contained miR-660 was identified to bind to KLHL21, reducing the binding between KLHL21 and inhibitor kappa B kinase β (IKKβ) to activate the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Interestingly, EV-loaded miR-660 from TAMs could be internalized by breast cancer cells. Moreover, silencing of KLHL21 increased the number of lung LNM foci in vivo, while EVs-contained miR-660 promoted cancerous cell invasion and migration.

Simultaneously, our preliminary clinical trial has demonstrated that Jianpi Jiedu Recipe (JPJDR) was an ideal alternative traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of CRC metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism of JPJDR in the prevention of CRC metastasis is not clear. In this study, we will investigate the regulatory effect of JPJDR on ITGBL1 levels in CRC-derived EVs, and to detect how JPJDR regulate ITGBL1-rich EVs mediated activation of fibroblasts to inhibit CRC metastasis.

Here, we reveal that ROS-mediated DNA oxidative damage signalling promotes tumour metastasis through increasing EVs release. Mechanistically, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) recognises and binds to its substrate 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), recruiting NF-κB to the synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) promoter and thereby triggering SYT7 transcription. The upregulation of SYT7 expression leads to increased release of E-cadherin-loaded EVs, which depletes intracellular E-cadherin, thereby inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, Th5487, the inhibitor of DNA binding activity of OGG1, blocks the recognition and transmission of oxidative signals, alleviates SYT7 expression and suppresses EVs release, thereby preventing tumour progression in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our study illuminates the significance of 8-oxoG/OGG1/SYT7 axis-driven EVs release in oxidative stress-induced tumour metastasis.

It is worth noting that the high-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell-derived exosomes have exhibited the ability to transform normal fibroblasts into CAFs, which further fosters the lung metastasis of low-metastatic HCC cells. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this tumor exosome-induced metastatic niche formation are poorly explored. In this study, the secreted protein arginyl aminopeptidase (RNPEP) was highly expressed in the plasma of patients with HCC. In addition, high-metastatic HCC cells showed augmented RNPEP expression levels in their exosomes. These exosomes induced obvious CAF-like properties in the human fibroblast cell line MRC-5, as evidenced by the increased CAF marker expression, and enhanced migratory ability. More strikingly, the secretions from high-metastatic tumor exosome-educated MRC-5 cells increased tumor stemness and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MHCC-97L cells, a low-metastatic HCC cell line. However, the knockdown of RNPEP in exosomes from high-metastatic HCC cells abated the changes described above.

The aggressive behavior of CSCs is guided by several intracellular signaling pathways such as WNT, NF-kappa-B, NOTCH, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT, PI3K/AKT1/MTOR, TGF/SMAD, PPAR and MAPK kinases, as well as extracellular vesicles such as exosomes, and extracellular signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, pro-angiogenetic and growth factors, which finely regulate CSC phenotype. In this scenario, tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key player in the establishment of a permissive tumor niche, where CSCs engage in intricate communications with diverse immune cells. The ""oncogenic"" immune cells are mainly represented by B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Among immune cells, macrophages exhibit a more plastic and adaptable phenotype due to their different subpopulations, which are characterized by both immunosuppressive and inflammatory phenotypes. Specifically, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) create an immunosuppressive milieu through the production of a plethora of paracrine factors (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, CCL1, CCL18) promoting the acquisition by CSCs of a stem-like, invasive and metastatic phenotype. TAMs have demonstrated the ability to communicate with CSCs via direct ligand/receptor (such as CD90/CD11b, LSECtin/BTN3A3, EPHA4/Ephrin) interaction. On the other hand, CSCs exhibited their capacity to influence immune cells, creating a favorable microenvironment for cancer progression. Interestingly, the bidirectional influence of CSCs and TME leads to an epigenetic reprogramming which sustains malignant transformation. Nowadays, the integration of biological and computational data obtained by cutting-edge technologies (single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, trajectory analysis) has significantly improved the comprehension of the biunivocal multicellular dialogue, providing a comprehensive view of the heterogeneity and dynamics of CSCs, and uncovering alternative mechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, the combination of biology and computational data will lead to the development of innovative target therapies dampening CSC-TME interaction. Here, we aim to elucidate the most recent insights on CSCs biology and their complex interactions with TME immune cells, specifically TAMs, tracing an exhaustive scenario from the primary tumor to metastasis formation."

Circular RNA (circRNA), a major component of exosomes, is involved in cancer metastasis through exosome-mediated delivery. This study identified a novel non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated circRNA, circ_0008803 in exosomes. We found that circ_0008803 promoted the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro and facilitated tumor growth in vivo. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that circ_0008803 was encapsulated in exosomes and transported to recipient cells. Upon release into recipient cells, circ_0008803 competitively bound to miR-432-5p, which upregulated the expression of transformer 2 beta homolog (TRA2B). Concurrently, circ_0008803 interacted with the ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1 (ELAVL1) and promoted the translocation of ELAVL1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The circ_0008803-ELAVL1 complex further interacted with the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of TRA2B, enhancing the stability of TRA2B in the cytoplasm. Through these mechanisms, the upregulated TRA2B activated the NF-κB pathway, thereby promoting the migration and invasion of recipient cells. Furthermore, elevated serum exosomal circ_0008803 levels correlated with advanced NSCLC stages and distant metastasis. In summary, this study highlights circ_0008803 as a novel exosomal circRNA implicated in NSCLC metastasis, providing mechanistic insights and underscoring its potential as a diagnostic biomarker."

In addition to ectodomain shedding, we provide further evidence that sE-cad is abundantly released in the form of exosomes. Mechanistically, sE-cad-positive exosomes heterodimerize with VE-cadherin on endothelial cells and transduce a novel sequential activation of β-catenin and NFκB signaling. In vivo and clinical data prove the relevance of sE-cad-positive exosomes for malignant ascites formation and widespread peritoneal dissemination. These data advance our understanding of the molecular regulation of angiogenesis in ovarian cancer and support the therapeutic potential of targeting sE-cad.

In this study, mechanistic insight was sought regarding exo-Anx II and its function in angiogenesis and breast cancer metastasis. Multiple in vitro and in vivo techniques were used to study the role of exo-Anx II in angiogenesis. Using atomic force microscopy and Western blotting, exo-Anx II expression was characterized in normal and breast cancer cells. In addition, organ-specific metastatic breast cancer cells and animal models were used to define the role exo-Anx II in breast cancer metastasis. Results revealed that exo-Anx II expression is significantly higher in malignant cells than normal and premetastatic breast cancer cells. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that exo-Anx II promotes tPA-dependent angiogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo analysis indicated that metastatic exosomes create a favorable microenvironment for metastasis, and exo-Anx II plays an important role in this process, as priming with Anx II-depleted exosomes reduces brain (∼4-fold) and lung (∼2-fold) metastasis. Upon delineating the mechanism, it was discovered that exo-Anx II causes macrophage-mediated activation of the p38MAPK, NF-κB, and STAT3 pathways and increased secretion of IL6 and TNFα. These data demonstrate an important role for exo-Anx II in breast cancer pathogenesis.

Huh-7 exosomes were characterized for size and exosome marker expressions (CD63, Alix). Exosome mediated osteoclast differentiation in the RAW 264.7 cells was monitored from day 1 to 6 and multinucleated osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity were analyzed. The osteoclastogenic factor expressions in the exosomes and osteoclast differentiation markers such as tumor necrosis factor receptor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), and cathepsin K (CTSK) were analyzed using western blot.

Analysis of osteoclastogenic factors in the exosomes showed that exosomes were specifically enriched with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Huh-7 exosomes promoted osteoclast differentiation by significantly increasing the number of TRAP-positive multi nucleated osteoclasts and resorption pits. Importantly, exosomes upregulated osteoclast markers TRAF6, NF-κB, and CTSK expressions. Further, neutralizing exosomal TNF-α reverted exosome-mediated osteoclast differentiation in RAW 264.7 cells.

Functional experiments demonstrated that miR-155-5p enhances cellular proliferation, motility, and invasive capacity while inhibiting apoptosis in BC. Mechanistically, miR-155-5p exerts its effects by directly suppressing Nedd4 Family Interacting Protein 1 (NDFIP1), thereby initiating activation of the NF-κB axis.

The cellular internalization of fluorescent-labeled exosomes was visualized by confocal microscopy. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to elucidate the oncogenic role of miR-20a-5p transferred by exosomes derived from CAFs in CRC progression. The underlying mechanisms were uncovered through luciferase reporter assay, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, as well as proliferation and migration assays. The expression levels of serum-derived circulating miR-20a-5p and miR-122-5p were significantly higher in CRC and were positively correlated with advanced stages of tumorigenesis and lymph node metastasis (LNM). In contrast, circulating miR-139-3p, miR-143-5p, and miR-193a-5p were down-regulated in CRC and associated with early tumorigenesis. Except for miR-139-3p, they showed a negative correlation with LNM status. Among the candidate miRNAs, significantly elevated levels of miR-20a-5p were observed in both cellular and exosomal fractions of CAFs. Our findings indicated that miR-20a-5p induces the expression of EMT markers, partly by targeting PTEN.

The exosomes derived from MSCs were isolated and identified by transmission electron microscope, nano-sight and western blot. The expression of miR-374a-5p was confirmed by qRT-PCR and its downstream target HAPLN1 by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of adhesion molecules of gastric cancer cells was detected by flow cytometry. MiR-374a-5p could regulate the expression of inflammatory factors by activating NF-κB signaling. The increase of MCP-1 and the decrease of IFN-γ promoted the migration of gastric cancer cells. The miR-374a-5p in MSCs could be encapsulated and delivered to gastric cancer cells by exosomes derived from MSCs. Exogenous miR-374a-5p up-regulated the expression of adhesion molecules in gastric cancer cells by targeting HAPLN1.

The objective of the present study was to explore the function and mechanism of MT-CAFs on progression of colon cancer. Here, a gene chip was used for a general analysis of gene expression changes in MSC-transformed CAF cells (MT-CAFs). Bioinformatic tool and western blot screened out the ion channel protein TRPC3 with significantly increased expression, and identify the function through two-photon microscope. The progression of cancer was detected via MTS, transwell and Wound Healing. ELISA deected the secretion of inflammation factors. TRPC3/NF-KB axis was identified by western blot and immunofluorescence. TRPC3 can caused calcium influx, which further activated the NF-KB signaling pathway. Knockdown or inhibition of TRPC3 in MSCs significantly reduced the activation of NF-KB, and decreased the growth, migration, and invasion of MT-CAFs. After TRPC3 knockdown, the ability of MT- CAFs to promote tumor migration and invasion was impaired. Conversely, the upregulation of TRPC3 expression in MT-CAFs had the opposite effect. In vivo, TRPC3 expressed on MSCs also contributed to the tumorigenesis and progression of cancer cells. In addition, the Oncomine and GEPIA databases showed that TRPC3 expression is higher in colon cancer tissues compared with normal colon tissues, and was positively correlated with the expression of the CAF genes alpha-smooth muscle (α-SMA/ACTA2) and fibroblast activation protein Alpha. The disease-free survival of patients with positive TRPC3 expression in MSCs was significantly shorter than those with negative expression. These results indicate that TRPC3 expressed on MT-CAFs plays a critical role in tumor progression via the NF-KB signaling pathway, and is correlated with poor prognosis in colon cancer patients. Therefore, TRPC3 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of colon cancer."

However, biomarkers providing a window into the longitudinal effects of biobehavioral factors on tumor biology over time are lacking. Exosome analysis is a novel strategy for in vivo monitoring of dynamic changes in tumor cells. This study examined exosomal profiles from patients with low or high levels of social support for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and β-adrenergic signaling. Exosomes were isolated from plasma sampled from a series of 40 women before primary surgical resection of advanced-stage, high-grade ovarian carcinoma. Samples were selected for analysis on the basis of extremes of low and high levels of social support. After exosomal isolation and RNA extraction, a microarray analysis of the transcriptome was performed. Primary analyses identified significant upregulation of 67 mesenchymal-characteristic gene transcripts and downregulation of 63 epithelial-characteristic transcripts in patients with low social support; this demonstrated increased EMT polarization (P = .0002). Secondary analyses using promoter sequence bioinformatics supported a priori hypotheses linking low social support to 1) increased activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) family transcription factors that mediate the β-adrenergic response to catecholamines via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathway (mean fold change for CREB: 2.24 ± 0.65; P = .0019; mean fold change for ATF: 2.00 ± 0.55; P = .0049) and 2) increased activity of the proinflammatory nuclear factor κB/Rel family of transcription factors (mean fold change: 2.10 ± 0.70; P = .0109). These findings suggest the possibility of leveraging exosomes as a noninvasive assessment of biobehavioral factors to help to direct personalized treatment approaches.

A better understanding of the mechanisms driving these processes could help uncover strategies to treat and prevent metastasis. In this study, we found that extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated cross-talk between colorectal cancer cells and fibroblasts facilitates inflammation and promotes metastasis. Fibroblasts were highly activated in primary tumors from patients with colorectal cancer with metastatic disease, and EVs secreted from highly metastatic colorectal cancer cells promoted fibroblast activation. Mechanistically, EV-packaged miR-99a-5p (EV-miR-99a) specifically targeted NLRP2 mRNA in fibroblasts and activated the proinflammatory NFκB signaling pathway, thereby converting normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). EV-miR-99a-activated CAFs enhanced the migratory capacity of colorectal cancer cells by secreting CCL7, which potently induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by increasing the expression of multiple E-cadherin repressors via the CCR5-mTOR-p70S6K pathway. Expression of miR-99a in colorectal cancer cells was upregulated by TGFβ1 secreted from CAFs in an NFκB-dependent manner, forming an miR-99a/TGFβ1 regulatory circuit. The communication between colorectal cancer cells and fibroblasts engendered a proinflammatory niche that facilitated metastasis, which could be abolished by treatment with the p70S6K inhibitor LY2584702. Clinically, EV-miR-99a levels in the plasma correlated with the metastatic status of patients with colorectal cancer. Together, these findings highlight the metastasis-promoting function of an inflammatory fibroblast niche induced by cancer cell-derived EVs and provide potential targets for the prediction and management of colorectal cancer metastasis. Extracellular vesicle-mediated cross-talk between colorectal cancer cells and fibroblasts orchestrates a proinflammatory niche that induces and facilitates metastasis and provides potential targets for disease prediction and therapeutic intervention."

This phenomenon is known as myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), which includes oxidative stress, inflammation, and further cell death. microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is known to play a significant role in regulating the immune response and inflammation, and has been studied for its potential impact on the improvement of heart function after myocardial injury. However, the delivery of miR-146a to the heart in a specific and efficient manner remains a challenge as extracellular RNAs are unstable and rapidly degraded. Milk exosomes (MEs) have been proposed as ideal delivery platform for miRNA-based therapy as they can protect miRNAs from RNase degradation. In this study, the effects of miR-146a containing MEs (MEs-miR-146a) on improvement of cardiac function were examined in a rat model of MIRI. To enhance the targeting delivery of MEs-miR-146a to the site of myocardial injury, the ischemic myocardium-targeted peptide IMTP was modified onto the surfaces, and whether the modified MEs-miR-146a could exert a better therapeutic role was examined by echocardiography, myocardial injury indicators and the levels of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-146a mediated NF-κB signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by western blotting and qRT-PCR to further elucidate its mechanisms. MiR-146 mimics were successfully loaded into the MEs by electroporation at a square wave 1000 V voltage and 0.1 ms pulse duration. MEs-miR-146a can be up-taken by cardiomyocytes and protected the cells from oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion induced damage in vitro. Oral administration of MEs-miR-146a decreased myocardial tissue apoptosis and the expression of inflammatory factors and improved cardiac function after MIRI. The miR-146a level in myocardium tissues was significantly increased after the administration IMTP modified MEs-miR-146a, which was higher than that of the MEs-miR-146a group. In addition, intravenous injection of IMTP modified MEs-miR-146a enhanced the targeting to heart, improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial tissue apoptosis and suppressed inflammation after MIRI, which was more effective than the MEs-miR-146a treatment. Moreover, IMTP modified MEs-miR-146a reduced the protein levels of IRAK1, TRAF6 and p-p65. Therefore, IMTP modified MEs-miR-146a exerted their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway.

The application of GqDNVs-gel resulted in a marked improvement in survival rates over a 14-day period post-MI, enhanced cardiac function, reduced infarct size, myocardial apoptosis, and excessive fibrosis, and facilitated endogenous repair. Through a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics analyses, alongside in vitro and in vivo experiments, we identified that the cardioprotective effect of GqDNVs are mediated through the inhibition of the p38 MAPK-NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Furthermore, GqDNVs contain abundant bioactive compounds, including proteins, genetic materials, lipids, polysaccharides, and flavonoids. GqDNVs-gel intervention can reshape the post-MI cardiac environment and modulate myocardial lipid metabolism, specifically impacting glycerophospholipid and α-linolenic acid metabolic pathways. The upregulation of the peptide Arg-Thr-Ile-Glu and the downregulation of phosphatidylethanolamine in the hearts of MI mice after GqDNVs-gel intervention may play crucial roles in modulating the associated metabolic pathways.

Herein, it is aimed to explore the effects of UMSC-Exos on macrophage polarization and their roles in cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI). These results show that UMSC-Exos improve cardiac function by increasing M2 macrophage polarization and reducing excessive inflammation. RNA-sequencing results identify Plcb3 as a key gene involved in UMSC-Exo-facilitated M2 macrophage polarization. Further bioinformatic analysis identifies exosomal miR-24-3p as a potential effector mediating Plcb3 downregulation in macrophages. Increasing miR-24-3p expression in macrophages effectively enhances M2 macrophage polarization by suppressing Plcb3 expression and NF-κB pathway activation in the inflammatory environment. Furthermore, reducing miR-24-3p expression in UMSC-Exos attenuates the effects of UMSC-Exos on M2 macrophage polarization. This study demonstrates that the cardiac therapeutic effects of UMSC-Exos are at least partially through promoting M2 macrophage polarization in an inflammatory microenvironment.

In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol (RSV)-primed ADSC-derived exosomes (RSV-primed Exo) could exert superior effects on alleviating intestinal IRI, and attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism. For the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of the RSV-primed Exo on intestinal IRI, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. IRI model was established in male C57BL/6 mice by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion. Histopathological analysis, intestinal barrier, the proportion of T cells, and macrophage polarization were investigated. RSV-primed Exo mediated immunosuppressive activity was investigated by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) co-culture assay in vitro. Flow cytometry determined macrophage polarization. ELISA assays detected the function of macrophages. Furthermore, the role of the NF-κB pathway in RSV-primed Exo induced macrophage polarization was also elucidated. In vivo modeling in intestinal IRI showed that RSV pretreatment enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of ADSC-derived exosomes. Compared with Untreated and Exo-treated groups, RSV-primed Exo effectively attenuated pathological damage of intestine characterized by severe edema of the mucosal villi and the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Exo therapy conspicuously restored the downregulated expression of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1 proteins in intestinal IRI mice and the administration of RSV-primed Exo further enhanced this restorative effect. Surprisingly, RSV-primed Exo significantly decreased the populations of M1 macrophages but increased the proportions of M2 macrophages in the intestine. Furthermore, RSV-primed Exo markedly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and increased anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) level in intestine. RSV-primed Exo improved macrophage immunoregulatory function associated with the NF-κB pathway, which exerted a potent therapeutic effect against intestinal IRI.

We developed and optimized an improved electroporation protocol for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. This protocol achieved a 68% success rate when applied to isolated hMSCs from the heart and epicardial fat of patients with ischemic heart disease. While cell editing lowered TLR4 expression in hMSCs, it did not affect classical markers of hMSCs, proliferation, and migration rate. Protein mass spectrometry analysis revealed that edited cells secreted fewer proteins involved in inflammation. Analysis of biological processes revealed that TLR4 editing reduced processes linked to inflammation and extracellular organization. Furthermore, edited cells expressed less NF-ƙB and secreted lower amounts of extracellular vesicles and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines than unedited hMSCs. Cell therapy with both edited and unedited hMSCs improved survival, left ventricular remodeling, and cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. Postmortem histologic analysis revealed clusters of edited cells that survived in the scar tissue 28 days after MI. Morphometric analysis showed that implantation of edited cells increased the area of myocardial islands in the scar tissue, reduced the occurrence of transmural scar, increased scar thickness, and decreased expansion index.

Exosomes contain different kinds of biologically active substances such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, miRNAs, and signaling molecules. These molecules are widely involved in cell-cell communication, cell signal transmission, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the positive effects exerted by ADSCs-Exo after hepatic ischemia-reperfusion with partial resection injury in rats. In this study, we found that the post-operative tail vein injection of ADSCs-Exo could effectively inhibit the expression of pyroptosis-related factors such as NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and GSDMD-N, and promote the expression of regeneration-related factors such as Cyclin D1 and VEGF. Moreover, we found that the above cellular activities were associated with the NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. According to the results, ADSCs and ADSCs-Exo can reduce pyroptosis in the injured liver and promote the expression of those factors related to liver regeneration, while they can inhibit the NF-κB pathway and activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, although adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) transplantation can reduce liver injury, it leads to a significant increase in the pyroptosis-related protein GSDMD-N expression.

Increasing evidence supports the role of the gut microbiota as a key player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unfortunately, the mechanisms behind the interplay between gut pathogens and AD are still elusive. It is known that bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) act as natural carriers of virulence factors that are central players in the pathogenesis of the bacteria. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common gastric pathogen and H. pylori infection has been associated with an increased risk to develop AD. Here, we are the first to shed light on the role of OMVs derived from H. pylori on the brain in healthy conditions and on disease pathology in the case of AD. Our results reveal that H. pylori OMVs can cross the biological barriers, eventually reaching the brain. Once in the brain, these OMVs are taken up by astrocytes, which induce activation of glial cells and neuronal dysfunction, ultimately leading to exacerbated amyloid-β pathology and cognitive decline. Mechanistically, we identified a critical role for the complement component 3 (C3)-C3a receptor (C3aR) signalling in mediating the interaction between astrocytes, microglia and neurons upon the presence of gut H. pylori OMVs. Taken together, our study reveals that H. pylori has a detrimental effect on brain functionality and accelerates AD development via OMVs and C3-C3aR signalling."

EVs are diverse, nano-sized vesicles, which transport proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids between cells over short and long expanses and hence are proficient for modulating the target cells. EVs released from neural cells are implicated in synaptic plasticity, neuron-glia interface, neuroprotection, neuroregeneration, and the dissemination of neuropathological molecules. This review confers the various properties of EVs secreted by astrocytes and their potential role in health and disease with a focus on evolving concepts. Naïve astrocytes shed EVs containing a host of neuroprotective compounds, which include fibroblast growth factor-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and apolipoprotein-D. Stimulated astrocytes secrete EVs with neuroprotective molecules including heat shock proteins, synapsin 1, unique microRNAs, and glutamate transporters. Well-characterized astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) generated in specific culture conditions and ADEVs that are engineered to carry the desired miRNAs or proteins are likely useful for treating brain injury and neurogenerative diseases. On the other hand, in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other neuroinflammatory conditions, EVs released by activated astrocytes appear to mediate or exacerbate the pathological processes. The examples include ADEVs spreading the dysregulated complement system in AD, mediating motoneuron toxicity in ALS, and stimulating peripheral leukocyte migration into the brain in inflammatory conditions. Strategies restraining the release of EVs by activated astrocytes or modulating the composition of ADEVs are likely beneficial for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Also, periodic analyses of ADEVs in the blood is useful for detecting astrocyte-specific biomarkers in different neurological conditions and for monitoring disease progression and remission with distinct therapeutic approaches."

In vivo imaging and immunofluorescence confirmed the transport of blood LPS-carrying bEVs across the BBB. The role of these bEVs in microglia was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Elevated LPS-containing bEVs were detected in the plasma of AD patients compared to healthy individuals. These bEVs activated microglial Piezo1, consequently precipitating an excessive synaptic pruning process mediated by the C1q-C3 complement pathway. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between the gut microbiota, bEVs, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity - a key early event in AD - offering insights for potential therapeutic interventions.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are present in different biofluids including plasma, whose cargo reflects cellular physiology. This work analysed EV proteome in sarcopenia and robust patients in the search for differentially contained proteins that can be used to diagnose the disease. Plasma small EVs (sEVs) from a total of 29 robust controls (aged 73.4 ± 5.6 years; 11 men and 18 women) and 49 sarcopenic patients (aged 82.3 ± 5.4 years; 15 men and 34 women) aged 65 years and older were isolated and their cargo was analysed by proteomics. Proteins whose concentration in sEVs was different between sarcopenic and robust patients were further validated using ELISA. The concentration of these candidates was correlated to the EWGSOP2 sarcopenia tests for low muscle strength and low physical performance, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were carried out to evaluate their diagnostic power, sensitivity and specificity. Proteomic analysis identified 157 sEVs proteins in both sarcopenic and robust samples. Among them, 48 proteins had never been reported in the ExoCarta nor Vesiclepedia databases. Statistical analysis revealed eight proteins whose concentration was significantly different between groups: PF4 (log2 FC = 4.806), OIT3 (log2 FC = -1.161), MMRN1 (log2 FC = -1.982), MASP1 (log2 FC = -0.627), C1R (log2 FC = 1.830), SVEP1 (log2 FC = 1.295), VCAN (FC = 0.937) and SPTB (log2 FC = 1.243).

A well characterized simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of HIV was used to profile extracellular vesicle enriched blood plasma fractions harvested during preinfection, acute infection, latent infection/ART treatment, and rebound after ART interruption.

AEVs (and, less effectively, NEVs) of AD participants induced Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) expression on recipient neurons (by immunohistochemistry), membrane disruption (by EthD-1 assay), reduced neurite density (by Tuj-1 immunohistochemistry), and decreased cell viability (by MTT assay) in rat cortical neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons. Demonstration of decreased cell viability was replicated in a separate cohort of autopsy-confirmed AD patients. These effects were not produced by CD81+ EVs from AD participants or AEVs/NEVs from FTLD or control participants, and were suppressed by the MAC inhibitor CD59 and other complement inhibitors. Our results support the stated hypothesis and should motivate future studies on the roles of neuronal MAC deposition and AEV/NEV uptake, as effectors of neurodegeneration in AD."

Emerging research has established that dysregulation of this intricate communication network critically contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, offering novel insights for therapeutic development. In this review, we dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying multifaceted microglia-neuron interactions in AD. Bidirectional communication occurs through neurotransmitter transmission, synaptic elimination, the secretion of signaling molecules and extracellular vesicles, and direct membrane contact. Disrupted crosstalk in AD triggers pathogenic cascades: cholinergic dysfunction induces microglial hyperactivation and oxidative stress; aberrant synaptic elimination accelerates memory loss; and neuron-derived pathological vesicles propagate neuroinflammation. Elucidating these interactions reveals promising therapeutic insights for AD. Targeting crosstalk pathways-such as activating TREM2, selectively inhibiting the complement cascade, or modulating inflammasome activity-may halt neurodegeneration while preserving essential immune surveillance. Moreover, integrating spatiotemporal omics with live imaging could dynamically track microglia-neuron crosstalk, revealing critical transition points from neuroprotection to neurodegeneration."

The astrocyte-derived exosome (ADE) complement proteins, including C3b and C5b-9, may be predictive biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment conversion to Alzheimer's disease dementia. We hypothesized that complement proteins might be involved in cognitive impairment during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of our study was to explore the correlation between the complement system and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with OSA. All participants with subjective snoring complaints from the Sleep Medicine Center underwent polysomnography. OSA was defined as apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 events/h. MCI was defined as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment < 26 and met the criteria: (1) a subjective cognitive impairment; (2) an objective impairment in 1 or more cognitive domains; (3) complex instrumental daily abilities can be slightly impaired but independent daily living abilities are maintained; and (4) no dementia. The ADEs were isolated immunochemically for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification of complement proteins, including C3b, C5b-9, and CD55. The participants who received continuous positive airway pressure were followed up and their complement protein levels were reassessed after 1 year of treatment. A total of 212 participants (66.98% males; mean age of 56.71 ± 10.10 years) were divided into the OSA+MCI group (n = 90), OSA-MCI group (n = 79), and controls (normal cognitive state without OSA) (n = 43). The ADE levels of C3b and C5b-9 in the OSA+MCI group were higher than those in the OSA-MCI and control groups. The C3b and C5b-9 were independently associated with cognitive impairment in patients with OSA. The relationship between apnea-hypopnea index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores was mediated by C3b and C5b-9. We found no linear correlation between the complement proteins and the severity of OSA. The complement proteins were negatively correlated with global cognitive performance and cognitive subdomains. The complement protein levels significantly decreased after continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Complement proteins were implicated in cognitive impairment in patients with OSA and may be promising biomarkers for predicting cognitive impairment in patients with OSA.

Across these conditions, EVs carry disease-relevant proteins that reflect and influence key pathological processes such as synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and cell death. Proteomic profiling of brain- and biofluid-derived EVs has uncovered specific biomarkers and signaling pathways, ranging from tau and α-synuclein in AD and PD to mutant SOD1 in ALS and complement activation in stroke and TBI. Moreover, cell-type-specific EVs (e.g., from neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and stem cells) have been shown to exert either protective or deleterious effects, modulating apoptosis, axonal regeneration, and immune responses. Recent evidence highlights the translational potential of EVs as non-invasive biomarkers and therapeutic vectors across multiple disorders. By mapping shared and divergent proteomic signatures in EVs, we review the mechanistic relevance and clinical utility of EVs in neurodegeneration and CNS injury."

Using approaches to increase or reduce vesicles production in microglia, by C9orf72 knock out or pharmacological inhibition, respectively, we provided mechanistic evidence linking extracellular vesicle release to pre-synaptic remodelling in neuron-microglia cultures. In C9orf72 knockout mice, we confirmed larger production of microglial extracellular vesicles and showed augmented C1q presynaptic deposition associated with enhanced engulfment by microglia in the early postnatal hippocampus. Finally, we provide evidence that microglia physiologically release more vesicles during the period of postnatal circuit refinement. These findings implicate abnormal release of microglial extracellular vesicles in both neurodevelopmental and age-related disorders characterized by dysregulated microglia-mediated synaptic pruning."

DLB shares motor and cognitive symptoms with Parkinson's disease (PD), and both are classified as synucleinopathies due to abnormal α-synuclein aggregation. Although α-synuclein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, it is also abundant in erythrocytes. Recent studies suggest a potential link between erythrocyte-derived α-synuclein and synucleinopathy pathology. Additionally, we previously reported that both erythrocytes and circulating medium and large extracellular vesicles (m/lEVs) in plasma from healthy subjects contain full-length and C-terminally truncated α-synuclein. In this study, we found that erythrocyte α-synuclein levels were significantly lower in DLB compared to AD, PD and healthy controls. Furthermore, α-synuclein levels in circulating m/lEVs were elevated in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. These findings provide new insights into the role of peripheral α-synuclein and suggest its potential utility as a diagnostic marker for DLB. While further validation is needed, erythrocyte-derived α-synuclein may complement nuclear medicine assessments in distinguishing DLB from other neurodegenerative disorders."

Accumulation of β-amyloid peptide 1-42 and phosphorylation of tau protein in the brain are the two main pathological features of AD. However, comprehensive studies have shown that neuroinflammation also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. Neuroinflammation is associated with neuronal death and abnormal protein aggregation and promotes the pathological process of β-amyloid peptide 1-42 and tau protein. The inflammatory components associated with AD include glial cells, complement system, cytokines and chemokines. In recent years, some researchers have focused on exosomes, a type of membrane nano vesicles. Exosomes can transport proteins, lipids, microRNAs and other signaling molecules to participate in a variety of signaling pathways for signal transmission or immune response, affecting the activity of target cells and participating in important pathophysiological processes. Therefore, exosomes play an essential role in intercellular communication and may mediate neuroinflammation to promote the development of AD. This paper reviews the occurrence and development of neuroinflammation and exosomes in AD, providing a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, the role of exosomes in the pathogenesis and treatment of AD is further described, demonstrating their potential as therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation and AD in the future."

GAT3 has been implicated in various neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, rendering it a therapeutically important drug target. To understand the mechanism of transport and inhibition, here we determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of human GAT3 in its apo form and in complex with the selective inhibitor SNAP-5114. Unexpectedly, we have discovered that SNAP-5114 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor at GAT3. SNAP-5114 binds at the orthosteric substrate binding pocket of GAT3 in its inward-open conformation, in agreement with its noncompetitive inhibition of GABA transport. In the apo state, GAT3 also adopts an inward-open conformation with the orthosteric substrate binding pocket exposed to cytoplasm, while an extensive network of interactions closes the extracellular gate. The structures, complemented with mutagenesis and radioligand uptake assays, show that the increased orthosteric substrate binding pocket volume and bulky moieties of SNAP-5114, drive the selective inhibition of GAT3 over GAT1. Our structural and functional studies reveal the mechanism of selective inhibition of GAT3 and provide a framework for GAT3-targeted rational drug design."

This review intends to synthesize emerging frameworks that reposition neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as progressive breakdowns of interpretive cellular logic, rather than mere terminal consequences of protein aggregation or synaptic attrition. The discussion aims to provide a detailed mapping of how critical signaling pathways-including PI3K-AKT-mTOR, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and integrated stress response cascades-undergo spatial and temporal disintegration. Special attention is directed toward the roles of RNA-binding proteins (e.g., TDP-43, FUS, ELAVL2), m6A epitranscriptomic modifiers (METTL3, YTHDF1, IGF2BP1), and non-canonical post-translational modifications (SUMOylation, crotonylation) in disrupting translation fidelity, proteostasis, and subcellular targeting. At the organelle level, the review seeks to highlight how the failure of ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), autophagosome-lysosome fusion machinery (STX17, SNAP29), and mitochondrial import/export systems (TIM/TOM complexes) generates cumulative stress and impairs neuronal triage. These dysfunctions are compounded by mitochondrial protease overload (LONP1, CLPP), UPR maladaptation, and phase-transitioned stress granules that sequester nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins and ribosomal subunits, especially in ALS and FTD contexts. Synaptic disassembly is treated not only as a downstream event, but as an early tipping point, driven by impaired PSD scaffolding, aberrant endosomal recycling (Rab5, Rab11), complement-mediated pruning (C1q/C3-CR3 axis), and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance linked to parvalbumin interneuron decay. Using insights from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, the review illustrates how regional vulnerability to proteostatic and metabolic stress converges with signaling noise to produce entropic attractor collapse within core networks such as the DMN, SN, and FPCN. By framing neurodegeneration as an active loss of cellular and network ""meaning-making""-a collapse of coordinated signal interpretation, triage prioritization, and adaptive response-the review aims to support a more integrative conceptual model. In this context, therapeutic direction may shift from damage containment toward restoring high-dimensional neuronal agency, via strategies that include the following elements: reprogrammable proteome-targeting agents (e.g., PROTACs), engineered autophagy adaptors, CRISPR-based BDNF enhancers, mitochondrial gatekeeping stabilizers, and glial-exosome neuroengineering. This synthesis intends to offer a translational scaffold for viewing neurodegeneration as not only a disorder of accumulation but as a systems-level failure of cellular reasoning-a perspective that may inform future efforts in resilience-based intervention and precision neurorestoration."

The intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of Aβ oligomers (AβO) in wild-type mice revealed a significant increase of EVs in the CSF, signifying that the presence of CSF-AβO is sufficient to induce increased EV secretion. Using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo approaches, we identified the CP as a major source of the CSF-EVs. Interestingly, AβO-induced, CP-derived EVs induced pro-inflammatory effects in mixed cortical cultures. Proteome analysis of these EVs revealed the presence of several pro-inflammatory proteins, including the complement protein C3. Strikingly, inhibition of EV production using GW4869 resulted in protection against acute AβO-induced cognitive decline. Further research into the underlying mechanisms of this EV secretion might open up novel therapeutic strategies to impact the pathogenesis and progression of AD."

The aim of this study was to identify the protein changes of serum exosomes in Parkinson disease (PD) patients with different disease progress types, and to identify potential biomarkers. The exosomes of PD patients with different severity and healthy control group were isolated from serum. The exosome proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry with label-free quantitative proteomics. A total of 429 proteins were identified, of which 14 were significantly different in mild and severe PD patients. The expression levels of 7 proteins, including pigmented epithelium-derived factor, afamin, apolipoprotein D and J, were significantly increased in PD patients. The expression levels of 7 proteins, including complement C1q and protein Immunoglobulin Lambda Variable 1-33 (IGLV1-33)Cluster -33, were decreased in PD patients. These differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, which confirmed that the interaction between prion diseases and ECM receptors was the most significant pathways of enrichment. The changes of proteins and pathways may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism of PD. Therefore, some of these proteins could be considered as potential biomarkers for early PD diagnosis."

The exosomal proteomes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and plasma, were obtained from three databases (ExoCarta, EVpedia and Vesiclepedia), and complemented with additional exosomal proteins already associated with AD but not found in the databases. The final biofluids' proteomes were submitted to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the exosomal Aβ-binding proteins that can constitute putative candidates were identified. Among these candidates, gelsolin, a protein known to be involved in inhibiting Abeta fibril formation, was identified, and it was tested in human samples. The levels of this Aβ-binding protein, with anti-amyloidogenic properties, were assessed in serum-derived exosomes isolated from controls and individuals with dementia, including AD cases, and revealed altered expression patterns. Identification of potential peripheral biomarker candidates for AD may be useful, not only for early disease diagnosis but also in drug trials and to monitor disease progression, allowing for a timely therapeutic intervention, which will positively impact the patient's quality of life."

Neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons triggered by aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein is a major pathogenic trait of PD. However, growing evidence indicates that peripheral processes, including metabolic changes, may precede and contribute to neurodegeneration. The present study was undertaken to identify a metabolic signature of PD through the quantification of serum amino acids and derivatives. Twenty older adults with PD (11 men and 9 women; mean age 73.1 ± 10.2 years) and 30 age-matched controls (14 men and 16 women; mean age 74.6 ± 4.3 years) were enrolled. A panel of 37 serum amino acids and derivatives was assessed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) followed by double cross-validation was used to characterize the relationship between amino acid profiles and PD. The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be three latent variables. The proportion of correct classifications was 99.3 ± 2.5% for participants with PD and 94.7 ± 3.0% for non-PD controls. Higher levels of β-amino butyric acid, cystine, ornithine, phosphoethanolamine, and proline defined the circulating amino acid profile of older people with PD. Controls were characterized by higher concentrations of 3-methyl-histidine, citrulline, and serine. Our findings indicate the existence of a distinct metabotype in older persons with PD. Future studies will have to establish whether changes in amino acid metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. This knowledge may be harnessed to identify novel disease biomarkers as well as new targets for interventions."

This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms of how PDAC-derived exosomes (Pex) modulate the liver microenvironment and promote metastasis. C57BL/6 mice were 'educated' by tail vein Pex injection. The intrasplenic injection liver metastasis and PDAC orthotopic transplantation models were used to evaluate liver metastasis. Stable cell lines CD44v6 (CD44 variant isoform 6) or C1QBP (complement C1q binding protein) knockdown or overexpression was established using lentivirus transfection or gateway systems. A total of 142 patients with PDAC in Huashan Hospital were retrospectively enrolled. Prognosis and liver metastasis were predicted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and logistic regression models. Pex tail vein injection induced the deposition of liver fibrotic extracellular matrix, which promoted PDAC liver metastasis. Specifically, the exosomal CD44v6/C1QBP complex was delivered to the plasma membrane of hepatic satellite cells (HSCs), leading to phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling molecules, which resulted in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Expression of Pex CD44v6 and C1QBP in PDAC patients with liver metastasis was significantly higher than in PDAC patients without liver metastasis, and simultaneous high expression of exosomal CD44v6 and C1QBP correlated with a worse prognosis and a higher risk of postoperative PDAC liver metastasis. The Pex-derived CD44v6/C1QBP complex is essential for the formation of a fibrotic liver microenvironment and PDAC liver metastasis. Highly expressed exosomal CD44v6 and C1QBP are promising biomarkers for predicting prognosis and liver metastasis in patients with PDAC."

At present, the molecular landscapes of solid tumours are established using surgical or biopsy tissue samples. Tissue-based tumour profiles are, however, subject to sampling bias, provide only a snapshot of tumour heterogeneity, and cannot be obtained repeatedly. Genomic profiles of circulating cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) have been shown to closely match those of the corresponding tumours, with important implications for both molecular pathology and clinical oncology. Analyses of circulating nucleic acids, commonly referred to as 'liquid biopsies', can be used to monitor response to treatment, assess the emergence of drug resistance, and quantify minimal residual disease. In addition to blood, several other body fluids, such as urine, saliva, pleural effusions, and cerebrospinal fluid, can contain tumour-derived genetic information. The molecular profiles gathered from ctDNA can be further complemented with those obtained through analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs), as well as RNA, proteins, and lipids contained within vesicles, such as exosomes. In this Review, we examine how different forms of liquid biopsies can be exploited to guide patient care and should ultimately be integrated into clinical practice, focusing on liquid biopsy of ctDNA - arguably the most clinically advanced approach."

Despite recent treatment advancements, patient survival rates remain low. The diagnosis of GBM traditionally relies on neuroimaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans and postoperative confirmation via histopathological and molecular analysis. Imaging techniques struggle to differentiate between tumor progression and treatment-related changes, leading to potential misinterpretation and treatment delays. Similarly, tissue biopsies, while informative, are invasive and not suitable for monitoring ongoing treatments. These challenges have led to the emergence of liquid biopsy, particularly through blood samples, as a promising alternative for GBM diagnosis and monitoring. Presently, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling offers a minimally invasive means of obtaining tumor-related information to guide therapy. The idea that blood or any biofluid tests can be used to screen many cancer types has huge potential. Tumors release various components into the bloodstream or other biofluids, including cell-free nucleic acids such as microRNAs (miRNAs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), proteins, extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes, metabolites, and other factors. These factors have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), presenting an opportunity for the minimally invasive monitoring of GBM as well as for the real-time assessment of distinct genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic changes associated with brain tumors. Despite their potential, the clinical utility of liquid biopsy-based circulating biomarkers is somewhat constrained by limitations such as the absence of standardized methodologies for blood or CSF collection, analyte extraction, analysis methods, and small cohort sizes. Additionally, tissue biopsies offer more precise insights into tumor morphology and the microenvironment. Therefore, the objective of a liquid biopsy should be to complement and enhance the diagnostic accuracy and monitoring of GBM patients by providing additional information alongside traditional tissue biopsies. Moreover, utilizing a combination of diverse biomarker types may enhance clinical effectiveness compared to solely relying on one biomarker category, potentially improving diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and addressing some of the existing limitations associated with liquid biomarkers for GBM. This review presents an overview of the latest research on circulating biomarkers found in GBM blood or CSF samples, discusses their potential as diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic indicators, and discusses associated challenges and future perspectives."

Mechanistically, EV C3 induces the secretion of CCL2 and CXCL1 by lung macrophages and subsequently enhances TAM polarization and PMN-MDSC recruitment. Notably, targeting the CCL2/CCR2 or CXCL1/CXCR2 axis with the inhibitors RS504393 or Navarixin, respectively, effectively suppresses lung metastasis induced by RCC-derived C3 in a mouse model. Clinically, RCC patients with high expression of C3 demonstrate poor prognosis.

This study is a retrospective analysis of 170 new NSCLC patients treated at 2 cancer centers within a 5-year period who received both tissue and liquid biopsy NGS as standard of care. Based on a treatment schema defined by testing sufficiency, biomarker detection, and turnaround time (TAT), physicians based the majority of their treatments on liquid biopsy results (73.5%) versus tissue biopsy (25.9%). Liquid biopsy NGS returned results on average 26.8 days faster than tissue and reported higher testing success.

There was no significant difference in time-to-treatment, or survival outcomes (overall survival and progression free survival) based on liquid versus tissue biopsy findings. This research demonstrates that liquid biopsy NGS is an effective tool to capture actionable genetic alterations in NSCLC. Due to its high concordance to tissue, faster TAT, and similarity in outcomes and time-to-treatment, liquid biopsy can be used either as a first-line test or concordantly with tissue biopsy to guide treatment decisions in NSCLC."

Integrative multi-omics approaches merge genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data; machine-learning frameworks detect subtle patterns and correlations, enabling dynamic, personalized surveillance. By detecting molecular and functional biomarkers early, clinicians can tailor therapy, monitor treatment response and intervene promptly. Challenges include low analyte abundance, assay variability, high costs and lack of standardized protocols, limiting clinical adoption. Prospective validation in large cohorts is critical. We highlight ongoing clinical trials such as ctDNA-guided adjuvant therapy and CTC-driven stratification studies that aim to establish clinical utility.

We revisit here the effects that extracellular vesicles of various origins have on innate immunity. Extracellular vesicles comprise a heterogeneous group of vesicles with different biogenesis, composition and biological properties, which include exosomes, microvesicles, apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and other extracellular vesicles still not well characterized. Extracellular vesicles released by pathogens, leukocytes, nonhematopoietic cells, tumor cells, and likely allografts, can either stimulate or suppress innate immunity via multiple mechanisms. These include transfer to target leukocytes of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators, membrane receptors, enzymes, mRNAs, and noncoding RNAs; and interaction of extracellular vesicles with the complement and coagulation systems. As a result, extracellular vesicles affect differentiation, polarization, activation, tissue recruitment, cytokine and chemokine production, cytolytic and phagocytic function, and antigen transfer ability, of different types of innate immune cells. The field of intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles is a rapid evolving area and the effects of pathogen-derived and host-derived extracellular vesicles on innate immunity in particular, have received increasing attention during the past decade.

The common liquid biopsy biomarkers are circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Each biomarker provides specific information based on its intrinsic characteristics. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in males worldwide. In men with low-grade localized prostate cancer, the disease can often be managed by active surveillance. For men who require treatment, the 5-year survival rate of localized prostate cancer is the highest among all cancer types, but the metastatic disease remains incurable. Metastatic prostate cancer invariably progresses to involve multiple bone sites and develops into a castration-resistant disease that leads to cancer death. The need to appropriately diagnose and guide the serial treatment of men with prostate cancer has led to the implementation of many studies to apply liquid biopsies to prostate cancer management. This review describes recent advancements in isolation and detection technology and the strength and weaknesses of the three circulating biomarkers. The clinical studies based on liquid biopsy results are summarized to depict the future perspective in the role of liquid biopsy on prostate cancer management."

Complement factor H (CFH) protects host cells from attack and destruction by the alternative pathway of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Here we show that CFH can protect exosomes from complement-mediated lysis and phagocytosis. CFH was found to be associated with EVs from a variety of tumor cell lines as well as EVs isolated from the plasma of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Higher levels of CFH-containing EVs correlated with higher metastatic potential of cell lines. GT103, a previously described antibody to CFH that preferentially causes CDC of tumor cells, was used to probe the susceptibility of tumor cell-derived exosomes to destruction. Exosomes were purified from EVs using CD63 beads. Incubation of GT103 with tumor cell-derived exosomes triggered exosome lysis primarily by the classical complement pathway as well as antibody-dependent exosome phagocytosis by macrophages. These results imply that GT103-mediated exosome destruction can be triggered by antibody Fc-C1q interaction (in the case of lysis), and antibody-Fc receptor interactions (in the case of phagocytosis). Thus, this work demonstrates CFH is expressed on tumor cell derived exosomes, can protect them from complement lysis and phagocytosis, and that an anti-CFH antibody can be used to target tumor-derived exosomes for exosome destruction via innate immune mechanisms. These findings suggest that a therapeutic CFH antibody has the potential to inhibit tumor progression and reduce metastasis promoted by exosomes."

In this review, we focus on the influence of CERS2 in bladder cancer (BC), approaching the existing literature about its structure and activity, as well as the miRNAs regulating its expression. From a mechanistic point of view, different explanations for the role of CERS2 as an antitumor protein have been proposed, including the production of long-chain ceramides, interaction with vacuolar ATPase, and its function as inhibitor of mitochondrial fission. In addition, we reviewed the literature specifically studying the expression of this gene in both BC and biopsy-derived tumor cell lines, complementing this with an analysis of public gene expression data and its association with disease progression. We also discuss the importance of CERS2 as a biomarker and the presence of CERS2 mRNA in extracellular vesicles isolated from urine."

The proteomic landscape of advanced melanoma remains poorly understood, especially regarding proteomic heterogeneity across metastases within patients. We collected 83 melanoma metastases from 19 different metastatic sites in 24 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma almost exclusively from the pre-immunotherapy era, using semi-rapid autopsies. The metastases were subjected to histopathological evaluation, RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics for protein quantitation and non-reference peptide (NRP) sequence detection using a proteogenomic data integration approach. NRPs associated with mutations frequently occurred in proteins related to focal adhesion, vesicle-mediated transport, MAPK signalling and immune response pathways across the cohort. Intrapatient heterogeneity was negligible when considering morphology and driver gene mutation status but was substantial at the proteogenomic level. This heterogeneity was not driven by metastasis location, albeit liver metastases exhibited distinct proteogenomic patterns, including upregulation of metabolic pathways. Cluster analysis outlined four proteomic clusters (C1-4) of the metastases, characterised by the upregulation of cell cycle and RNA-splicing (C1), mitochondrial processes (C3), extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune pathways (C2) and ECM and vesicle-mediated transport pathways (C4). Around two-thirds of patients had metastases that had strongly distinct phenotypes. Patients in our cohort whose metastases were primarily assigned to clusters C1 and C3 exhibited shorter overall survival than patients whose metastases were categorised mainly into the C2 and C4 clusters. Our unique multi-metastasis cohort captured the proteogenomic heterogeneity of immunotherapy-naïve melanoma distant metastases, establishing a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying novel therapeutic targets to complement current immunotherapies.

A structured literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect for studies published between 2010 and 2025. Peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the clinical or translational role of non-nucleic acid biomarkers in early lung cancer detection were included, while non-English publications, case reports, and non-cancer studies were excluded. Among these, non-nucleic acid biomarkers including proteins, extracellular vesicles (EVs), circulating tumour cells (CTCs), and metabolic signatures are emerging as promising diagnostic tools. Protein markers such as CEA, CYFRA 21-1, and NSE demonstrate clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. EVs provide a stable reservoir of tumour-derived molecules that reflect the tumour microenvironment. CTCs offer real-time insights into tumour progression and metastasis, while metabolomic profiling using LC-MS and NMR identifies distinct metabolic fingerprints linked to lung cancer pathogenesis. This review critically assesses recent advances, applicability, and technological platforms for detecting non-nucleic acid biomarkers, and compares them not only with nucleic acid-based biomarkers but also with conventional diagnostic methods such as imaging and tissue biopsies. Integrating these biomarkers into clinical workflows may complement existing tools, enhance early diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately improve survival outcomes in lung cancer patients."

Using a bone metastatic model of enzalutamide-resistant PCa, we first characterized an axis of EV-mediated communication between PCa cells and bone marrow that is marked by in vitro and in vivo PCa EV uptake by bone marrow myeloid cells, activation of NF-κB signalling, enhanced osteoclast differentiation, and reduced myeloid thrombospondin-1 expression. We then employed a targeted, biomimetic approach to reduce myeloid cell cholesterol in vitro and in vivo prior to conditioning with PCa EVs. Reducing myeloid cell cholesterol prevented the uptake of PCa EVs by recipient myeloid cells, abolished NF-κB activity and osteoclast differentiation, stabilized thrombospondin-1 expression, and reduced metastatic burden by 77%.

We explore how these dimensions complement each other in tracking disease progression, predicting recurrence, and guiding personalized therapy. Emphasis is placed on recent technological advances, clinical utility, and future integration into practice. This multidimensional perspective underscores the transformative potential of liquid biopsy in improving BCa outcomes."

Small-EVs (30-150 nm) were isolated from two sources-the bulk ascites and the ascitic fluid-derived tumor cell cultures-and assessed with a combination of imaging, proteomic profiling, and protein expression analyses. In addition, Gene Ontology and pathway analysis were performed using different databases and bioinformatic tools. The results proved that the small-EVs derived from the two sources exhibited significantly different stiffness and size distributions. The bulk ascitic fluid-derived small-EVs were predominantly involved in the complement and coagulation cascade. Small-EVs derived from ascites cell cultures contained a robust proteomic profile of extracellular matrix remodeling regulators, and we observed an increase in transforming growth factor-β-I (TGFβI), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and fibronectin expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. When measured in the two sources, we demonstrated that fibronectin exhibited opposite expression patterns in small-EVs in response to chemotherapy. These findings highlight the importance of an ascites cell isolation workflow in investigating the treatment-induced cancer adaption processes."

We produced clonal cell lines derived from the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, using the UbC-StarTrack system, which allowed tracking of multiple clones by color: GFP C3, mKO E10 and Sapphire D7. Characterization of these clones was performed by growth rate, cell metabolic activity, wound healing, invasion assays and genetic and epigenetic arrays. Tumorigenicity was tested by orthotopic and intravenous injections. Clonal cooperation was evaluated by medium complementation, co-culture and co-injection assays. Characterization of these clones in vitro revealed clear genetic and epigenetic differences that affected growth rate, cell metabolic activity, morphology and cytokine expression among cell lines. In vivo, all clonal cell lines were able to form tumors; however, injection of an equal mix of the different clones led to tumors with very few mKO E10 cells. Additionally, the mKO E10 clonal cell line showed a significant inability to form lung metastases. These results confirm that even in stable cell lines heterogeneity is present. In vitro, the complementation of growth medium with medium or exosomes from parental or clonal cell lines increased the growth rate of the other clones. Complementation assays, co-growth and co-injection of mKO E10 and GFP C3 clonal cell lines increased the efficiency of invasion and migration. These findings support a model where interplay between clones confers aggressiveness, and which may allow identification of the factors involved in cellular communication that could play a role in clonal cooperation and thus represent new targets for preventing tumor progression."

Our previous research showcased enhanced and organized subcutaneous vascularization using three-dimensional bioprinted patches containing HUVEC-derived EVs in immunodeficient animal models. In this context, stress conditions on the cells of origin further boosted the EVs' neoangiogenic potential. Since neovascularization is the first regenerative target requiring restoration, the present study aims to complement our previous work by employing an injectable gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel functionalized with HUVEC-derived EVs in a pathological condition of acute myocardial infarction. This bioactive hydrogel resulted in reduced fibrosis, improved contractility, and promoted angiogenesis, showing promise in countering tissue deterioration and addressing vascular deficits. Moreover, the molecular characterization of EVs through miRNome and proteomic analyses further supports their potential as bio-additives for hydrogel functionalization. This cell-free approach mitigates immune rejection and oncogenic risks, offering innovative therapeutic advantages."

Here, we present novel data on heart and brain aggregation in mice following experimental MI, induced by left coronary artery (LCA) ligation. Infarcted and peri-infarcted heart tissue, and whole cerebra, were isolated from mice at sacrifice, 7 days following LCA ligation. Sham-MI mice (identical surgery without ligation) served as controls. We purified detergent-insoluble aggregates from these tissues, and quantified key protein constituents by high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Infarct heart tissue had 2.5- to 10-fold more aggregates than non-infarct or sham-MI heart tissue (each P = 0.001). Protein constituents from MI cerebral aggregates overlapped substantially with those from human Alzheimer's disease brain. Prior injection of mice with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) exosomes, shown to limit infarct size after LCA ligation, reduced cardiac aggregation ~ 60%, and attenuated markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in heart and brain (GRP78, ATF6, P-PERK) by 50-75%. MI also elevated aggregate constituents enriched in Alzheimer's disease (AD) aggregates, such as proteasomal subunits, heat-shock proteins, complement C3, clusterin/ApoJ, and other apolipoproteins. These data provide novel evidence that aggregation is elevated in mouse hearts and brains after myocardial ischemia, leading to cognitive impairment resembling AD, but can be attenuated by exosomes or drug (CDN1163) interventions that oppose ER stress."

Processing removed serum carrier proteins, coagulation factors and complement proteins from the original platelet lysate and the resultant SCPL-EVs carried a range of trophic factors and multiple recognised cardioprotective miRNAs. As such, SCPL-EVs protected rodent and human cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury and stimulated angiogenesis of human cardiac microvessel endothelial cells. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction with reperfusion, SCPL-EV delivery using echo-guided intracavitary percutaneous injection produced large improvements in cardiac function, reduced scar formation and promoted angiogenesis.

The present study aimed to test whether RIPC-induced plasma exosomes (RIPC-Exo) exert protective effects on myocardial I/R injury by inhibiting complement activation and inflammation and whether exosomal heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) mediates these effects. Rat hearts underwent 30 min of coronary ligation followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Plasma exosomes were isolated from RIPC rats and injected into the infarcted myocardium immediately after ligation. Sixty rats were randomly divided into Sham, I/R, I/R + RIPC-Exo (50 µg/µl), and RIPC-Exo + GA (geldanamycin, 1 mg/kg, administration 30 min before ligation) groups. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the release of myocardial markers (LDH, cTnI and CK-MB), infarct size, the expression of HSP90, complement component (C)3, C5a, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM-1) were assessed. RIPC-Exo treatment significantly reduced I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the release of myocardial markers (LDH, cTnI and CK-MB) and infarct size. These beneficial effects were accompanied by decreased C3 and C5a expression, decreased inflammatory factor levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, and ICAM-1), decreased JNK and Bax, and increased Bcl-2 expression. Meanwhile, the expression of HSP90 in the exosomes from rat plasma increased significantly after RIPC. However, treatment with HSP90 inhibitor GA significantly reversed the cardioprotection of RIPC-Exo, as well as activated complement component, JNK signalling and inflammation, indicating that HSP90 in exosomes isolated from the RIPC was important in mediating the cardioprotective effects during I/R. Exosomal HSP90 induced by RIPC played a significant role in cardioprotection against I/R injury, and its function was in part linked to the inhibition of the complement system, JNK signalling and local and systemic inflammation, ultimately alleviating I/R-induced myocardial injury and apoptosis by the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and the downregulation of proapoptotic Bax."

Our experiments have demonstrated that significantly lower levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase in mice treated with hepatocyte-derived exosomes compared with mice treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Furthermore, hepatocyte-derived exosomes inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, and suppressed the entry of inflammatory cells into the liver following hepatic IRI. Complement 3d (C3d) expression showed a notable decrease in exosome-treated mice compared with PBS-treated mice, suggesting that hepatocyte-derived exosomes effectively inhibited complement activation during hepatic IRI. Blocking the fusion of exosomes with cells using Annexin V weakened the protective effects of the exosomes against hepatic IRI. Our findings highlight the ability of hepatocyte-derived exosomes to mitigate hepatic IRI by inhibiting complement activation.

EV bioactive cargo includes graft antigens, costimulatory/inhibitory molecules, cytokines, growth factors, and functional microRNAs (miRNAs) that may modulate expression of recipient cell genes. As paracrine factors, neutrophil- and macrophage-derived EVs exert immunosuppressive and immune-stimulating effects on dendritic cells, respectively. Dendritic cell-derived EVs mediate alloantigen spreading and modulate antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. At systemic level, EVs exert pleiotropic effects on complement and coagulation. Depending on their biogenesis, they can amplify complement activation or shed complement inhibitors and prevent cell lysis. Likewise, endothelial- and platelet-derived EVs can exert procoagulant/prothrombotic effects and also promote endothelial survival and angiogenesis after ischemic injury. Kidney endothelial- and tubular-derived EVs play a key role in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and during the healing process; additionally, they can trigger rejection by inducing both alloimmune and autoimmune responses. Endothelial EVs have procoagulant/pro-inflammatory effects and can release sequestered self-antigens, generating a tissue-specific autoimmunity. Renal tubule-derived EVs shuttle pro-fibrotic mediators (TGF-β and miR-21) to interstitial fibroblasts and modulate neutrophil and T-lymphocyte influx. These processes can lead to peritubular capillary rarefaction and interstitial fibrosis-tubular atrophy. Different EVs, including those from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have been employed as a therapeutic tool in experimental models of rejection and IRI. These particles protect tubular and endothelial cells (by inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation-fibrogenesis or by inducing autophagy) and stimulate tissue regeneration (by triggering angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration). Finally, urinary and serum EVs represent potential biomarkers for delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection. In conclusion, EVs sustain an intricate crosstalk between graft tissue and innate/adaptive immune systems. EVs play a major role in allorecognition, IRI, autoimmunity, and alloimmunity and are promising as biomarkers and therapeutic tools in KT."

Adipose tissue-specific Adipsin transgenic mice (Adipsin-Tg) and wild-type controls were exposed to cold conditions (4 °C) for four weeks. Cardiac function, perivascular fibrosis, and coronary microvascular function were assessed. Serum Adipsin levels were selectively reduced by injecting AAV9-shRab27a into inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT). Exosomes derived from the ingWAT of Adipsin-Tg mice were isolated and tested for their effects on endothelial barrier function under cold stress. Mechanistic studies focused on the RhoA/Rock1 signaling pathway, cytoskeletal remodeling, and adherens junctions (AJs) stability in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs). Cold exposure significantly reduced Adipsin expression in ingWAT, accompanied by impaired cardiac diastolic function, increased perivascular fibrosis, and disrupted coronary microvasculature. Overexpression of Adipsin in adipose tissue alleviated these pathological changes, whereas knockdown of serum Adipsin via AAV9-shRab27a reversed the protective effects. Exosomes enriched with Adipsin restored endothelial barrier integrity and improved microvascular function under cold stress. Mechanistically, Adipsin-enriched exosomes inhibited the RhoA/Rock1 pathway and MLC phosphorylation, preserved cytoskeletal architecture, and stabilized AJs by preventing VE-cadherin phosphorylation and internalization.

Substantial progress has been made in identifying positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD, but they have limited use as front-line diagnostic tools. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells and contain a subset of their parental cell composition, including lipids. EVs are released from the brain into the periphery, providing a potential source of tissue and disease specific lipid biomarkers. However, the EV lipidome of the central nervous system is currently unknown and the potential of brain-derived EVs (BDEVs) to inform on lipid dyshomeostasis in AD remains unclear. The aim of this study was to reveal the lipid composition of BDEVs in human frontal cortex, and to determine whether BDEVs have an altered lipid profile in AD. Using semi-quantitative mass spectrometry, we describe the BDEV lipidome, covering four lipid categories, 17 lipid classes and 692 lipid molecules. BDEVs were enriched in glycerophosphoserine (PS) lipids, a characteristic of small EVs. Here we further report that BDEVs are enriched in ether-containing PS lipids, a finding that further establishes ether lipids as a feature of EVs. BDEVs in the AD frontal cortex offered improved detection of dysregulated lipids in AD over global lipid profiling of this brain region.  AD BDEVs had significantly altered glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid levels, specifically increased plasmalogen glycerophosphoethanolamine and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acyl containing lipids, and altered amide-linked acyl chain content in sphingomyelin and ceramide lipids relative to CTL. The most prominent alteration was a two-fold decrease in lipid species containing anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving docosahexaenoic acid. The in-depth lipidome analysis provided in this study highlights the advantage of EVs over more complex tissues for improved detection of dysregulated lipids that may serve as potential biomarkers in the periphery."

In this study, it is found that Arf1 deficiency first induced surplus fatty acid synthesis through the AKT-mTORC1-SREBP1-FASN axis, which further triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial stress cascade via calcium flux. The organelle stress cascade further caused mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to be released into cytoplasm. Concurrently, the FASN-driven fatty acid synthesis in the Arf1-deficient neurons might also induce accumulation of sphingolipids in lysosomes that caused dysfunction of autophagy and lysosomes, which further promoted lysosomal stress and mitochondria-derived extracellular vesicles (MDEVs) release. The released MDEVs carried mtDNA into microglia to activate the inflammatory pathways and neurodegeneration. The studies on neuronal lipid droplets (LDs) and recent studies of microglial LDs suggest a unified pathological function of LDs in NDs: activating the inflammatory pathways in microglia. This finding potentially provides new therapeutic strategies for NDs."

Several mechanisms mediate intercellular signaling, including tunneling nanotubes, gap junctions, and extracellular vesicles (EV). Depending on local and systemic conditions, EVs may contain cargoes that promote survival, neuroprotection, or pathology. Our understanding of pathologic intercellular signaling has been bolstered by disease models using neurons derived from human pluripotent stems cells (hPSC). Here, we used hPSC-derived retinal ganglion cells (hRGC) and the mouse visual system to investigate the influence of modulating EV generation on intercellular trafficking and cell survival. We probed the impact of EV modulation on cell survival by decreasing the catabolism of sphingomyelin into ceramide through inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), using GW4869. We assayed for cell survival in vitro by probing for annexin A5, phosphatidylserine, viable mitochondria, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In vivo, we performed intraocular injections of GW4869 and measured RGC and superior colliculus neuron density and RGC anterograde axon transport. Following twenty-four hours of dosing hRGCs with GW4869, we found that inhibition of nSMase decreased ceramide and enhanced GM1 ganglioside accumulation. This inhibition also reduced the density of small EVs, increased the density of large EVs, and enriched the pro-apoptotic protein, annexin A5. Reducing nSMase activity increased hRGC apoptosis initiation due to enhanced density and uptake of apoptotic particles, as identified by the annexin A5 binding phospholipid, phosphatidylserine. We assayed intercellular trafficking of mitochondria by developing a coculture system of GW4869-treated and naïve hRGCs. In treated cells, inhibition of nSMase reduced the number of viable mitochondria, while driving mitochondrial reactive oxygen species not only in treated, but also in naive hRGCs added in coculture. In mice, 20 days following a single intravitreal injection of GW4869, we found a significant loss of RGCs and their axonal recipient neurons in the superior colliculus. This followed a more dramatic reduction in anterograde RGC axon transport to the colliculus. Overall, our data suggest that perturbing the physiologic catabolism of sphingomyelin by inhibiting nSMase reorganizes plasma membrane associated sphingolipids, alters the profile of neuron-generated EVs, and promotes neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo by shifting the balance of pro-survival versus -degenerative EVs.

Metabolic alterations observed in the course of neurodegeneration favor ceramide-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling, while the levels of the neuroprotective S1P are reduced.

Since multiple sclerosis pathology involves inflammatory T cell lymphocyte production of interferon-gamma and a resulting increase in oxidative stress, we tested the hypothesis that spreading depression disrupts myelin through similar signaling pathways. Rat hippocampal slice cultures were initially used to explore myelin loss in spreading depression, since they contain T cells, and allow for controlled tissue microenvironment. These experiments were then translated to the in vivo condition in neocortex. Spreading depression in slice cultures induced significant loss of myelin integrity and myelin basic protein one day later, with gradual recovery by seven days. Myelin basic protein loss was abrogated by T cell depletion, neutralization of interferon-gamma, and pharmacological inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase-2. Conversely, one day after exposure to interferon-gamma, significant reductions in spreading depression threshold, increases in oxidative stress, and reduced levels of glutathione, an endogenous neutral sphingomyelinase-2 inhibitor, emerged. Similarly, spreading depression triggered significant T cell accumulation, sphingomyelinase activation, increased oxidative stress, and reduction of gray and white matter myelin in vivo. Myelin disruption is involved in spreading depression, thereby providing pathophysiological links between multiple sclerosis and migraine with aura. Myelin disruption may promote spreading depression by enhancing aberrant excitability. Thus, preservation of myelin integrity may provide novel therapeutic targets for migraine with aura."

Here, we study the coassembly of the ganglioside GM1 and the Aβ peptides Aβ40 and 42 by means of microfluidic diffusional sizing, confocal microscopy, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. We also study the effects of lipid-peptide interactions on the amyloid aggregation process by fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results reveal coassembly of GM1 lipids with both Aβ monomers and Aβ fibrils. The results of the nonseeded kinetics experiments show that Aβ40 aggregation is delayed with increasing GM1 concentration, while that of Aβ42 is accelerated. In seeded aggregation reactions, the addition of GM1 leads to a retardation of the aggregation process of both peptides. Thus, while the effect on nucleation differs between the two peptides, GM1 may inhibit the elongation of both types of fibrils. These results shed light on glycolipid-peptide interactions that may play an important role in Alzheimer's pathology."

Knockdown of LAPTM4B inhibited the ceramide-mediated increase in exosome release completely. Fluorescence microscopy observations indicated that exogenous ceramides promote the transport of multivesicular bodies to the plasma membranes in a LAPTM4B-dependent manner. Similarly, inhibition of acid ceramidase, which tends to induce intracellular ceramide accumulation, increased exosome production by SH-SY5Y cells in a LAPTM4B-dependent manner. Furthermore, the level of amyloid-ß protein (Aß) was decreased in neuronal cells following treatment with exogenous ceramide or inhibition of acid ceramidase, and this effect was attributed to the LAPTM4B-dependent efflux of Aß-containing exosomes. Overall, these findings reveal the novel machinery involved in exosome secretion regulated by ceramides and LAPTM4B, and may contribute to efforts to ameliorate the cellular accumulation of neurodegenerative agents such as Aß."

We report, for the first time, that human tau expression elevates brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity. To determine the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting this elevation, we evaluated PDDC, the first potent, selective, orally bioavailable, and brain-penetrable nSMase2 inhibitor in the transgenic PS19 AD mouse model. Additionally, we directly evaluated the effect of PDDC on tau propagation in a mouse model where an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding P301L/S320F double mutant human tau was stereotaxically-injected unilaterally into the hippocampus. The contralateral transfer of the double mutant human tau to the dentate gyrus was monitored. We examined ceramide levels, histopathological changes, and pTau content within EVs isolated from the mouse plasma. Similar to human AD, the PS19 mice exhibited increased brain ceramide levels and nSMase2 activity; both were completely normalized by PDDC treatment. The PS19 mice also exhibited elevated tau immunostaining, thinning of hippocampal neuronal cell layers, increased mossy fiber synaptophysin immunostaining, and glial activation, all of which were pathologic features of human AD. PDDC treatment reduced these changes. The plasma of PDDC-treated PS19 mice had reduced levels of neuronal- and microglial-derived EVs, the former carrying lower pTau levels, compared to untreated mice. In the tau propagation model, PDDC normalized the tau-induced increase in brain ceramides and significantly reduced the amount of tau propagation to the contralateral side. PDDC is a first-in-class therapeutic candidate that normalizes elevated brain ceramides and nSMase2 activity, leading to the slowing of tau spread in AD mice."

The causal relationship between these defects and neurodegeneration is supported by human genetic studies identifying disease mutations in genes controlling endolysosomal function and autophagy. The canonical view is that defects in these processes lead to impaired lysosomal clearance of proteins prone to form toxic oligomeric assemblies and/or aggregates, ultimately resulting in cellular pathologies that define these disorders. Because lysosomes mediate the clearance of a large number of lipids, lipid storage is frequently associated with compromised endolysosomal and autophagic function. However, an emerging notion, supported by our recent study on class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34, is that neuronal endolysosomal and autophagic dysfunction can manifest itself with the occurrence of physically damaged endomembranes and with the release of exosomes enriched for Amyloid Precursor Protein COOH-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) as well as atypical phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP).

Using thioflavin T fluorescence to monitor aggregation kinetics, we found that exosomes catalyze the process in a similar manner as a low concentration of preformed α-synuclein fibrils. The exosomes reduce the lag time indicating that they provide catalytic environments for nucleation. The catalytic effects of exosomes derived from naive cells and cells that overexpress α-synuclein do not differ. Vesicles prepared from extracted exosome lipids accelerate aggregation, suggesting that the lipids in exosomes are sufficient for the catalytic effect to arise. Using mass spectrometry, we found several phospholipid classes in the exosomes, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and the gangliosides GM2 and GM3. Within each class, several species with different acyl chains were identified. We then prepared vesicles from corresponding pure lipids or defined mixtures, most of which were found to retard α-synuclein aggregation.

We established an obese mouse model by feeding mice a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) and assessed cognitive function through a series of behavioral tests. To investigate the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), we inhibited EVs secretion by intraperitoneally administering GW4869, a neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) inhibitor, to 12-week HFD-fed male mice. Using comprehensive proteomic sequencing of brain-derived EVs, we identified NFIA as a potentially candidate protein. A series of in vivo and in vitro experiments were then conducted to confirmed the astrocytic origin of NFIA and neuronal uptake of ADEVs. Further, ADEVs isolated from primary cultured astrocytes under high glucose conditions were administered to both wild-type mice and primary cultured neurons to demonstrate their mediating role. Additionally, we developed adeno-associated virus (AAV) constructs to specifically knockdown the target gene Nfia of astrocyte to validate these findings. Following 16 weeks of HFD feeding, obese mice exhibited significant cognitive impairment, which was significantly alleviated by GW4869 administration through inhibition of ceramide-dependent EVs secretion. Proteomic analysis revealed a marked upregulation of NFIA protein in brain-derived EVs from obese mice, with astrocytes identified as the predominant cellular origin. ADEVs containing NFIA has been found to specifically accumulated in the hippocampal neurons both in vivo and in vitro. As expected, ADEVs isolated from high glucose-treated primary astrocytes induced substantial cognitive decline in healthy adult mice and caused synaptic injury in primary cultured neurons. Of note, astrocyte-specific knockdown of the Nfia gene resulted in improved synaptic function and ameliorated cognitive impairment in obese mice. These findings demonstrated that elevated levels of NFIA packaged within ADEVs contributed to hippocampal synaptic injury under obesity-induced stress condition.

Similarly, the analysis of patients with primary breast cancer and healthy women showed an overall accuracy of 95% for their correct classification. Furthermore, primary and metastatic breast cancers were correctly classified with an overall accuracy of 89.5%. This reveals that the blood plasma EVs' lipids may be a promising source of biomarkers for detection of breast cancer. Additionally, this study demonstrates the usefulness of untargeted lipidomics in the study of EV lipid composition and EV-associated biomarker discovery studies. This is a proof-of-concept study and a starting point for further analysis on the identification of EV-based biomarkers for breast cancer."

They influence the behavior of tumor cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, affecting tumor aggressiveness, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Furthermore, abnormal expression of sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes modulates the secretion of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TDEs), which are key players in creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, remodeling the extracellular matrix, and facilitating oncogenic signaling within in situ tumors and distant pre-metastatic niches (PMNs). Understanding the role of sphingolipids in the biogenesis of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TDEs) and their bioactive contents can pave the way for new biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, ultimately enhancing comprehensive tumor treatment strategies."

To study this, we combined a genetically engineered mouse model of mammary carcinoma with syngeneic transplantation and primary tumor resection to generate isogenic cells from primary tumors and their corresponding lung micrometastases. Metabolic analyses indicated that micrometastatic cells increase proline production at the expense of glutathione synthesis, leading to a reduction in total glutathione levels. Micrometastatic cells also have altered sphingomyelin metabolism, leading to increased intracellular levels of specific ceramides. The combination of these metabolic adaptations alters extracellular vesicle (EV) production to render the microenvironment more permissive for invasion. Indeed, micrometastatic cells shut down Rab27-dependent production of EVs and, instead, switch on neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSM2)-dependent EV release. EVs released in an nSM2-dependent manner from micrometastatic cells, in turn, influence the ability of fibroblasts to deposit extracellular matrix, which promotes cancer cell invasiveness. These data provide evidence that metabolic rewiring drives invasive processes in metastasis by influencing EV release."

Mice were intrasplenically injected with CRC cells. LR was induced by 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) to mimic the CRLM in the context of LR. The alteration of corresponding CER-metabolizing genes was examined. The biological roles of CER metabolism in vitro and in vivo were examined by performing a series of functional experiments. Induction of LR augmented apoptosis but promoted matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to increase the invasiveness of metastatic CRC cells, resulting in aggressive CRLM. Up-regulation of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) was determined in the regenerating hepatocytes after LR induction and persisted in the CRLM-adjacent hepatocytes after CRLM formation. Hepatic Smpd3 knockdown was found to further promote CRLM in the context of LR by abolishing mitochondrial apoptosis and augmenting the invasiveness in metastatic CRC cells by up-regulating MMP2 and EMT through promoting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Mechanistically, we found that hepatic SMPD3 controlled the generation of exosomal CER in the regenerating hepatocytes and the CRLM-adjacent hepatocytes. The SMPD3-produced exosomal CER critically conducted the intercellular transfer of CER from the hepatocytes to metastatic CRC cells and impeded CRLM by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis and restricting the invasiveness in metastatic CRC cells. The administration of nanoliposomal CER was found to suppress CRLM in the context of LR substantially. SMPD3-produced exosomal CER constitutes a critical anti-CRLM mechanism in LR to impede CRLM, offering the promise of using CER as a therapeutic agent to prevent the recurrence of CRLM after PH."

However, ceramide accumulation in meta-inflammation, condition that associates obesity with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, favors the deregulation of pathways such as insulin signaling, and induces structural rearrangements on mitochondrial membrane, modifying its permeability and altering the flux of ions and other molecules. Considering the wide biological processes in which sphingolipids are implicated, they have been associated with diseases that present abnormalities in their energetic metabolism, such as breast cancer. In this sense, sphingolipids could modulate various cell features, such as growth, proliferation, survival, senescence, and apoptosis in cancer progression; moreover, ceramide metabolism is associated to chemotherapy resistance, and regulation of metastasis. Cell⁻cell communication mediated by exosomes and lipoproteins has become relevant in the transport of several sphingolipids. Therefore, in this work we performed a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art about the multifaceted roles of ceramides, specifically the deregulation of ceramide metabolism pathways, being a key factor that could modulate neoplastic processes development.

The mechanisms involved in the mitogenic actions of C1P include activation of MEK/ERK1-2, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, or PKC-α, whereas promotion of cell survival required a substantial reduction of ceramide levels through inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase or sphingomyelinase activities. C1P and ceramide kinase (CerK), the enzyme responsible for its biosynthesis in mammalian cells, play key roles in tumor promotion and dissemination. CerK-derived C1P can be secreted to the extracellular milieu by different cell types and is also present in extracellular vesicles. In this context, whilst cell proliferation is regulated by intracellularly generated C1P, stimulation of cell migration/invasion requires the intervention of exogenous C1P.

Next, we analyzed the function of T cells in vitro in the presence or absence of NB patients' BM-derived EV, in terms of proliferation and cytokine production. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of immune checkpoints on EV and the clinical outcome of patients. We found a higher expression of CD56 on EVs derived from BM of patients with NB than in those from healthy donors (HD). However, CD56 expression was not dependent on BM infiltration of NB cells. Moreover, the analysis of GD2 expression revealed that only a small fraction of EVs was released by infiltrating NB cells, whereas the majority may derive from BM-resident cells. BM-derived EVs from NB patients display a higher expression of HLA-G and PD-L1 than those derived from HD. Nonetheless, such EVs are able to modulate T cell immune responses. We measured a robust response, in vitro, towards a common bacterial antigen, including the release of GM-CSF and proinflammatory cytokines, like IFN-a and IL-6, from mononuclear cells. Some of these immunomodulatory features are dependent on the expression of HLA-G and PD-L1, whereas others may rely on other mechanism(s). Finally, a high expression of CD56, HLA-G and PD-L1 on BM-derived EVs may represent a good prognostic factor. We described the presence of HLA-G and PDL1-bearing EVs in the BM of NB patients, which may represent a mechanism performed by resident BM cells to counteract the inflammation occurring in the BM microenvironment of NB patients."

Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in solid tumors worldwide, is particularly notorious for its poor prognosis due to distant metastases, especially to the brain and bone. These metastases considerably reduce patient survival and contribute to therapeutic resistance. In this study, we utilized amphiphilic dendrimer-supramolecular-probe-modified nitrocellulose membranes to efficiently enrich exosomes harvested from bone-metastatic, brain-metastatic, and nonmetastatic lung cancer cells. Subsequent comprehensive lipidomic profiling was performed to identify distinct lipid species encapsulated within these exosomes. Two specific ceramide species, Cer d18:1/22:0 and Cer d18:1/24:0, were pinpointed as key lipids associated with the NSCLC metastatic potential. Functional assays demonstrated that exosomes derived from metastatic cells markedly enhanced the migratory capacity of the recipient lung cancer cells. However, the exogenous supplementation of these ceramides could effectively counteract such pro-migratory effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of exosome-mediated sphingolipid metabolism in NSCLC metastasis, validate the two ceramides as potential biomarkers, and establish a proof-of-concept strategy for targeting exosomal lipid reprogramming within the metastatic cascade."

We observed that treatment with A. calamus significantly downregulated the expression of Rab27a and nSMase2 in all tested cells. NTA analysis showed that inhibition of Rab27a and nSMase2 reduced exosome secretion from breast cancer cells. We conducted metabolic profiling of A. calamus extract to reveal the phytochemicals present and docked them on Rab27a and nSMase2 to decipher the compounds responsible for protein inhibition. Molecular dynamic simulations were conducted on lead compounds, and we observed that calcitriol lactone showed the most stable binding interactions with nSMase2. Treatment of breast cancer cells with calcitriol lactone significantly downregulated nSMase2 expression.

However, the molecular basis remains elusive. In this study, the mechanism of α2, 6-sialylation-mediated specific microRNAs (miRNA) sorting into exosomes was illustrated. We performed miRNA profiling analysis to compare exosomes from HCC cell lines that differ only in α2, 6-sialylation status. A total of 388 differentially distributed miRNAs were identified in wild-type and β-galactoside α2, 6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal-I) knockdown MHCC-97H cells-derived exosomes. Neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSmase2), an important regulator mediating the sorting of exosomal miRNAs, was found to be a target of ST6Gal-I. The reduction of α2, 6-sialylation could impair the activity of nSmase2, as well as the nSmase2-dependent exosomal miRNAs sorting. This α2,6-sialylation-dependent sorting exerted an augmentation of motility on recipient HCC cells. Our data further demonstrated that α2,6-sialylation-mediated sorting of exosomal miR-100-5p promoted the migration and invasion of recipient HepG2 cells via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The cellular metastasis-related gene CLDN11 was confirmed as a direct target of exosomal miR-100-5p, which elevated the mobility of recipient HCC cells. In conclusion, our results showed that α2,6-sialylation modulates nSmase2-dependent exosomal miRNAs sorting and promotes HCC progression."

But the role of this pathway in MM cell function, exosome function and miR regulation remains unknown. In this study, we showed that C6 ceramide (an exogenous ceramide supplement, 1.25-40 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis in human MM OPM2 cell line, which were associated with elevated caspase 3/9 and PARP cleavage. We also found that C6 ceramide (5-20 μmol/L) dose-dependently stimulated exosome secretion and increased exosomal levels of tumor-suppressive miRs (miR 202, miR 16, miR 29b and miR 15a). Of note, exosomes from C6 ceramide-treated OPM2 cells could influence the proliferation and apoptosis of the recipient OPM2 cells, which correlated with increased tumor-suppressive exosomal miRs. In contrast, GW4869 (a ceramide inhibitor, 5-20 μmol/L) exerted the opposite effects on the regulation of MM function, exosome secretion and miR levels in MM exosomes. However, exosomes from GW4869-treated OPM2 cells had no effect on these miRs and the survival of targeted OPM2 cells.

Intercellular communication between heterogeneous tumor cells enhances cellular activation and adaptation to specific microenvironments. One mechanism of intercellular communication is the delivery of miRNAs through tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). In this context we have observed that conditioned media from a highly invasive cell subpopulation (BLM-HI) enhances the invasive capacity of the parental cell line (BLM). Therefore, we hypothesized that this complex change of cellular behavior is influenced by EV-transported miRNAs. The treatment of BLM cells with EVs derived from BLM-HI cells resulted in a significantly enhanced invasive capacity, as observed in Matrigel-embedded spheroids and in 2D Boyden chamber assays, with a dose-dependent effect. Conversely, the invasive capacity of BLM cells was reduced when secretion of EVs was inhibited by a sphingomyelinase inhibitor. To investigate the molecular mechanisms behind this effect, we performed next-generation sequencing and identified an enrichment of miR-1246 in these EVs. In functional analyses we demonstrated that both the EV mediated delivery of miR-1246 as well as overexpression contributes to the enhanced invasiveness of BLM cells. We identified a binding site of miR-1246 in the 3'UTR of cyclin G2 (CCNG2) and demonstrated direct binding by a luciferase reporter assay.Increased expression of CCNG2 has been associated with cancer metastasis and poor patient outcomes in other malignancies.

However, there is increasing evidence that non-cardiomyocyte resident cells in the heart (as discussed in a separate review in this Spotlight series) as well as circulating cells and factors play important roles in this pathology. For example, erythrocytes, in addition to their main oxygen-ferrying role, can protect the heart from IR injury via the export of nitric oxide bioactivity. Platelets are well-known to be involved in haemostasis and thrombosis, but beyond these roles, they secrete numerous factors including sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P), platelet activating factor, and cytokines that can all strongly influence the development of IR injury. This is particularly relevant given that most STEMI patients receive at least one type of platelet inhibitor. Moreover, there are large numbers of circulating vesicles in the blood, including microvesicles and exosomes, which can exert both beneficial and detrimental effects on IR injury. Some of these effects are mediated by the transfer of microRNA (miRNA) to the heart. Synthetic miRNA molecules may offer an alternative approach to limiting the response to IR injury.

Using cultures of primary hepatocytes, we tested whether hepatocyte exosomes induced proliferation of hepatocytes in vitro. Using models of ischemia/reperfusion injury and partial hepatectomy, we evaluated whether hepatocyte exosomes promote hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in vivo. Hepatocyte exosomes, but not exosomes from other liver cell types, induce dose-dependent hepatocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, hepatocyte exosomes directly fuse with target hepatocytes and transfer neutral ceramidase and sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) causing increased synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) within target hepatocytes. Ablation of exosomal SK prevents the proliferative effect of exosomes. After ischemia/reperfusion injury, the number of circulating exosomes with proliferative effects increases. Our data shows that hepatocyte-derived exosomes deliver the synthetic machinery to form S1P in target hepatocytes resulting in cell proliferation and liver regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion injury or partial hepatectomy.

Therefore, the present study aims to identify whether exosomes (Exo) released from SDF1-overexpressing MSCs display a beneficial effect on ischemic myocardial infarction. Initially, a gain-of-function study was performed to investigate the function of SDF1 in ischemic myocardial cells and cardiac endothelial cells. Coculture experiments were performed to measure potential exosomic transfer of SDF1 from MSCs to ischemic myocardial cells and cardiac endothelial cells. During the coculture experiments, exosome secretion was disrupted by neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869 and upregulated exosomal SDF1 using SDF1 plasmid. Effects of Exo-SDF1 on cardiac function in MI mice were investigated in vivo. MSCs suppressed myocardial cell apoptosis and promoted microvascular regeneration of endothelial cells through secretion of exosomes. The addition of GW4869 led to increased apoptotic capacity of myocardial cells, decreased microvascular formation ability of endothelial cells, enhanced autophagy ability, and elevated Beclin-1 level as well as ratio of LC3II/LC3I. Overexpression of SDF1 and Exo-SDF1 inhibited apoptosis and autophagy of myocardial cells, but promoted tube formation of endothelial cells. The interference of PI3K signaling pathway promoted apoptosis and autophagy of myocardial cells, but inhibited tube formation of endothelial cells. SDF1 activated the PI3K signaling pathway. Exo-SDF1 protected cardiac function of MI mice and inhibited myocardial tissue damage. This study provided evidence that SDF1 overexpression in MSCs-derived exosomes inhibited autophagy of ischemic myocardial cells and promoted microvascular production of endothelial cells."

ADSC-exosome treatment mitigated MI-induced cardiac damage by suppressing cardiac dysfunction, cardiac apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ADSC-exosome treatment promoted macrophage M2 polarization. Further experiments found that S1P/SK1/S1PR1 signaling was involved in the ADSC-exosome-mediated myocardial repair. Silencing of S1PR1 reversed the inhibitory effect of ADSC-exosomes on MI-induced cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis in vitro. ADSC-exosome-induced macrophage M2 polarization was also reversed after downregulation of S1PR1 under hypoxia conditions, which promoted NFκB and TGF-β1 expression, and suppressed the MI-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory response.

We also demonstrated that the chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, regulate liver recovery and regeneration after I/R injury. In the current study, we sought to determine if the regulatory effects of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on liver recovery and regeneration might occur via altered release of hepatocyte exosomes. We found that hepatocyte release of exosomes was dependent upon CXCR1 and CXCR2. CXCR1-deficient hepatocytes produced fewer exosomes, whereas CXCR2-deficient hepatocytes produced more exosomes compared to their wild-type controls. In CXCR2-deficient hepatocytes, there was increased activity of neutral sphingomyelinase (Nsm) and intracellular ceramide. CXCR1-deficient hepatocytes had no alterations in Nsm activity or ceramide production. Interestingly, exosomes from CXCR1-deficient hepatocytes had no effect on hepatocyte proliferation, due to a lack of neutral ceramidase and sphingosine kinase. The data demonstrate that CXCR1 and CXCR2 regulate hepatocyte exosome release. The mechanism utilized by CXCR1 remains elusive, but CXCR2 appears to modulate Nsm activity and resultant production of ceramide to control exosome release. CXCR1 is required for packaging of enzymes into exosomes that mediate their hepatocyte proliferative effect."

The serum levels of transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as histological changes were examined. Primary hepatocytes and human hepatocyte cell line HL7702 were used to test whether exosomes could induce hepatocytes proliferation in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of proliferation markers (proliferation cell nuclear antigen, PCNA; Phosphohistone-H3, PHH3) were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Moreover, SK inhibitor (SKI-II) and S1P1 receptor antagonist (VPC23019) were used to investigate the role of sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent pathway in the effects of hiPSC-MSCs-Exo on hepatocytes. hiPSCs were efficiently induced into hiPSC-MSCs that had typical MSC characteristics. hiPSC-MSCs-Exo had diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm and expressed exosome markers (Alix, CD63 and CD81). After hiPSC-MSCs-Exo administration, hepatocyte necrosis and sinusoidal congestion were markedly suppressed in the ischemia/reperfusion injury model, with lower histopathological scores. The levels of hepatocyte injury markers AST and ALT were significantly lower in the treatment group compared to control, and the expression levels of proliferation markers (PCNA and PHH3) were greatly induced after hiPSC-MSCs-Exo administration. Moreover, hiPSC-MSCs-Exo also induced primary hepatocytes and HL7702 cells proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. We found that hiPSC-MSCs-Exo could directly fuse with target hepatocytes or HL7702 cells and increase the activity of sphingosine kinase and synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Furthermore, the inhibition of SK1 or S1P1 receptor completely abolished the protective and proliferative effects of hiPSC-MSCs-Exo on hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that hiPSC-MSCs-Exo could alleviate hepatic I/R injury via activating sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway in hepatocytes and promote cell proliferation.

Mice (C57BL/6J) inhaled either He gas or adjusted room air. Functional measurements were performed in the isolated Langendorff perfused heart at 24 h post He inhalation. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry (EPR) of samples was carried out at 24 h post He inhalation.

Additionally, transmission electron microscopy analysis of cardiac tissue and serum function and metabolomic analysis were performed. In contrast to cardioprotection observed in in vivo models, the isolated Langendorff perfused heart revealed no protection after He inhalation. However, levels of Cav-1/3 were reduced 24 h after He inhalation in whole-heart tissue, and Cav-3 was increased in exosomes from PFP. Addition of serum to muscle cells in culture or naïve ventricular tissue increased mitochondrial metabolism without increasing reactive oxygen species generation.

In this study, we investigated whether SJP treatment affected exosome release from C-MSCs in vitro. C-MSCs prepared from mice were treated with SJP (62.5 μg/mL), TMP (25 μg/mL) or BOR (15 μg/mL). Using an acetylcholinesterase activity assay, we found that both SJP and TMP treatment significantly increased exosome secretion compared to the control ethanol treatment. The neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) pathway was important in exosome formation and packaging. But neither the level of nSMase2 mRNA nor the level of protein changed following SJP, TMP or BOR treatment, suggesting that SJP stimulated exosome release via an nSMase2-independent pathway. The Rab27a and Rab27b GTPases controlled different steps of the exosome secretion pathway. We showed that SJP treatment significantly increased the protein levels of Rab27a, SYTL4 (Rab27a effector) and Rab27b compared with the control treatment. SJP treatment also significantly upregulated the mRNA level of Rab27b, rather than Rab27a. Moreover, SJP-induced increase of C-MSC-exosome release was inhibited by Rab27b knockdown, suggesting that SJP promotes exosome secretion from C-MSCs via a GTPase-dependent pathway.

Some identified microglia in specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we comprehensively review the biology of microglia and the roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and Huntington's disease.

Apparently, targeting the interaction between APP and Fe65 can offer a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Recently, exosome, a type of extracellular vesicle with diameter around 30-200 nm, has gained much attention as a potential delivery tool for brain diseases, including AD, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, their efficient uptake by autologous cells, and their ability to be surface-modified with target-specific receptor ligands. Here, the engineering of hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes to overexpress Fe65, enabled the development of a novel exosome-based targeted drug delivery system, which carried Corynoxine-B (Cory-B, an autophagy inducer) to the APP overexpressed-neuron cells in the brain of AD mice. The Fe65-engineered HT22 hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes (Fe65-EXO) loaded with Cory-B (Fe65-EXO-Cory-B) hijacked the signaling and blocked the natural interaction between Fe65 and APP, enabling APP-targeted delivery of Cory-B.

Microglia are the primary phagocytes in the brain and have been well-documented as inducers of neuroinflammation. How and to what extent microglia and their exosomes impact α-synuclein pathology has not been well delineated. We report here that when treated with human α-synuclein preformed fibrils, exosomes containing α-synuclein released by microglia are fully capable of inducing protein aggregation in the recipient neurons. Additionally, when combined with microglial proinflammatory cytokines, these exosomes further increased protein aggregation in neurons. Inhibition of exosome synthesis in microglia reduced α-synuclein transmission. The in vivo significance of these exosomes was demonstrated by stereotaxic injection of exosomes isolated from α-synuclein preformed fibrils treated microglia into the mouse striatum. Phosphorylated α-synuclein was observed in multiple brain regions consistent with their neuronal connectivity. These animals also exhibited neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal pathway in a time-dependent manner. Depleting microglia in vivo dramatically suppressed the transmission of α-synuclein after stereotaxic injection of preformed fibrils. Mechanistically, we report here that α-synuclein preformed fibrils impaired autophagy flux by upregulating PELI1, which in turn, resulted in degradation of LAMP2 in activated microglia.

Moreover, they are critical to alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation and propagation. Plasma exosomes derived from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD-exo) reportedly evoked α-syn aggregation and inflammation in microglia. In turn, microglia internalized and released exosomal α-syn, enhancing α-syn propagation. However, the specific mechanism through which PD-exo influences α-syn degradation remains unknown. Exosomes were extracted from the plasma of patients with PD by differential ultracentrifugation, analyzed using electron microscopy (EM) and nanoparticle flow cytometry, and stereotaxically injected into the unilateral striatum of the mice. Transmission EM was employed to visualize lysosomes and autophagosomes in BV2 cells, and lysosome pH was measured with LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-160. Cathepsin B and D, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), ATP6V1G1, tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein, calnexin, α-syn, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1, and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blotting, and α-syn, LAMP1, and ATP6V1G1 were also observed by immunofluorescence. Small interfering ribonucleic acid against V1G1 was transfected into BV2 cells and primary microglia using Lipofectamine® 3000. A PD mouse model was established via injection with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) into mice. A lentiviral-mediated strategy to overexpress ATP6V1G1 in the brain of MPTP-treated mice was employed. Motor coordination was assessed using rotarod and pole tests, and neurodegeneration in the mouse substantia nigra and striatum tissues was determined using immunofluorescence histochemical and western blotting of tyrosine hydroxylase. PD-exo decreased the expression of V1G1, responsible for the acidification of intra- and extracellular milieu. This impairment of lysosomal acidification resulted in the accumulation of abnormally swollen lysosomes and decreased lysosomal enzyme activities, impairing lysosomal protein degradation and causing α-syn accumulation. Additionally, V1G1 overexpression conferred the mice neuroprotection during MPTP exposure. Pathogenic protein accumulation is a key feature of PD, and compromised V-type ATPase dysfunction might participate in PD pathogenesis. Moreover, V1G1 overexpression protects against neuronal toxicity in an MPTP-based PD mouse model, which may provide opportunities to develop novel therapeutic interventions for PD treatment."

In this study, we engineered dopamine onto the surface of adipose-derived stem cell EVs (Dopa-EVs) utilizing a facile, two-step cross-linking approach. This engineering enhanced neuronal uptake of the EVs in primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells, a process shown to be competitively inhibited by dopamine pretreatment and dopamine receptor antibodies. Notably, Dopa-EVs demonstrated increased brain accumulation in mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Therapeutically, Dopa-EVs administration led to the rescue of dopaminergic neuronal loss and amelioration of behavioural deficits in both 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and α-Syn PFF-induced PD models. Furthermore, we observed that Dopa-EVs stimulated autophagy evidenced by the upregulation of Beclin-1 and LC3-II. These findings collectively indicate that surface modification of EVs with dopamine presents a potent strategy for targeting dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The remarkable therapeutic potential of Dopa-EVs, demonstrated in PD models, positions them as a highly promising candidate for PD treatment, offering a significant advance over current therapeutic modalities."

Accordingly, neurons invest considerable cellular resources in chaperones, protein degradation, autophagy and mitophagy to maintain proteostasis and mitochondrial quality. Complicating the challenges of neuroprotection, misfolded human disease proteins and mitochondria can move into neighbouring cells via unknown mechanisms, which may promote pathological spread. Here we show that adult neurons from Caenorhabditis elegans extrude large (approximately 4 μm) membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that can contain protein aggregates and organelles. Inhibition of chaperone expression, autophagy or the proteasome, in addition to compromising mitochondrial quality, enhances the production of exophers. Proteotoxically stressed neurons that generate exophers subsequently function better than similarly stressed neurons that did not produce exophers. The extruded exopher transits through surrounding tissue in which some contents appear degraded, but some non-degradable materials can subsequently be found in more remote cells, suggesting secondary release. Our observations suggest that exopher-genesis is a potential response to rid cells of neurotoxic components when proteostasis and organelle function are challenged. We propose that exophers are components of a conserved mechanism that constitutes a fundamental, but formerly unrecognized, branch of neuronal proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control, which, when dysfunctional or diminished with age, might actively contribute to pathogenesis in human neurodegenerative disease and brain ageing."

Stem cells communicate with cells through secreted exosomes (Exos), the present study aimed to explore whether Exos secreted by hucMSCs could function instead of hucMSCs. hucMSCs were successfully isolated and characterized, and shown to contribute to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-stimulated SH-SY5Y cell proliferation; hucMSC-derived Exos were also involved in this process. The Exos were purified and identified, and then labeled with PKH 26, it was found that the Exos could be efficiently taken up by SH-SY5Y cells after 12 h of incubation. Pretreatment with Exos promoted 6-OHDA-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells to proliferate and inhibited apoptosis by inducing autophagy. Furthermore, Exos reached the substantia nigra through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo, relieved apomorphine-induced asymmetric rotation, reduced substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron loss and apoptosis, and upregulated the level of dopamine in the striatum. These results demonstrate that hucMSCs-Exos have a treatment capability for PD and can traverse the BBB, indicating their potential for the effective treatment of PD."

Correlative light-electron microscopy revealed that majority of the extracellular mitochondria are in free form and, on rare occasions, some are enclosed in membrane-surrounded vesicles. Rotenone- and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-induced mitochondrial quality impairment promotes the extracellular release of depolarized mitochondria. Overexpression of PRKN (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase), which has a pivotal role in mitophagy regulation, suppresses the extracellular mitochondria release under basal and stress condition, whereas its knockdown exacerbates it. Correspondingly, overexpression of PRKN-independent mitophagy regulators, BNIP3 (BCL2 interacting protein 3) and BNIP3L/NIX (BCL2 interacting protein 3 like), suppress extracellular mitochondria release. Autophagy-deficient cell lines show elevated extracellular mitochondria release. These results imply that perturbation of mitophagy pathway prompts mitochondria expulsion.

Genetic mutations and post-translational modifications, such as α-syn phosphorylation, have been identified among the multiple factors supporting α-syn accrual during PD. A decline in the clearance capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosomal systems, together with mitochondrial dysfunction, have been indicated as major pathophysiological mechanisms of PD neurodegeneration. The accrual of misfolded α-syn aggregates into soluble oligomers, and the generation of insoluble fibrils composing the core of intraneuronal Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites observed during PD neurodegeneration, are ignited by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS activate the α-syn aggregation cascade and, together with the Lewy bodies, promote neurodegeneration. However, the molecular pathways underlying the dynamic evolution of PD remain undeciphered. These gaps in knowledge, together with the clinical heterogeneity of PD, have hampered the identification of the biomarkers that may be used to assist in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognostication.

The hippocampus, cortex, and blood plasma extracellular vesicles of 3- and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice were analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Subsequent bioinformatics and biochemical analyses were performed to compare the molecular signatures between wild type and 5xFAD mice across different brain regions and age groups to elucidate disease pathology. There was a unique signature of significantly altered proteins in the hippocampal and cortical proteomes of 3- and 6-month-old mice. The plasma extracellular vesicle proteomes exhibited distinct informatic features compared with the other proteomes. Furthermore, the regulation of several canonical pathways (including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling) differed between the hippocampus and cortex. Twelve potential biomarkers for the detection of early-stage Alzheimer's disease were identified and validated using plasma extracellular vesicles from stage-divided patients. Finally, integrin α-IIb, creatine kinase M-type, filamin C, glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase 2, and lysosomal α-mannosidase were selected as distinguishing biomarkers for healthy individuals and early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients using machine learning modeling with approximately 79% accuracy.

However, mounting evidence reveals that autophagy in fact heavily regulates protein secretion through diverse mechanisms. First, autophagy is closely involved in the unconventional secretion of leaderless proteins, a pool of proteins destined extracellularly, but lacking an ER-targeted leader sequence, and thus manufactured in the cytosol. Autophagy-related (ATG) genes now appear instrumental to the underlying pathways, hence the recently coined concept of secretory autophagy, or better ATG gene-dependent secretion. Indeed, ATG genes regulate unconventional protein secretion at multiple levels, ranging from intracellular inflammatory signaling, for example, through the control of mitochondrial health and inflammasome activity, to trafficking of leaderless proteins. Moreover, perhaps less expectedly, autophagy also participates in the control of conventional secretion, intersecting the secretory apparatus at multiple points, though with surprising differences among professional secretory cell types that disclose remarkable and unpredicted specificity. This review synopsizes the multiple mechanisms whereby autophagy interfaces with conventional and unconventional protein secretory pathways and discusses the relative teleology.

In this study, it is found that Arf1 deficiency first induced surplus fatty acid synthesis through the AKT-mTORC1-SREBP1-FASN axis, which further triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial stress cascade via calcium flux.

Under stress conditions, neurons and glial cells exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and a fragmented network, which further leads to lysosomal dysfunction, thereby inhibiting autophagic flux and enhancing exosome release. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on mitochondrial regulation of cell death, organelle dynamics, and vesicle trafficking, emphasizing their significant contributions to neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we explore the emerging field of nanomedicine in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.

Analysis of the structure of Hsp90-Cdc37-kinase complexes demonstrates the way in which Cdc37 interacts with and controls the folding of a large proportion of intracellular protein kinases. This co-chaperone thus stands at the hub of a multitude of intracellular signaling networks. Indeed, the influence of Cdc37 reaches beyond the housekeeping pathways of protein folding into the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes. This co-chaperone has attracted attention as a potential intermediate in carcinogenesis. Cdc37 is an attractive potential target in cancer due to (1) high expression in a number of tumor types and (2) control of multiple signaling pathways. These properties indicate (3) a potential for selectivity due to its elevated expression in malignant cells and (4) robustness, as the co-chaperone may control multiple growth signaling pathways and thus be less prone to evolution of resistance than less versatile oncoproteins. Cdc37 may also be involved in other aspects of pathophysiology and has been shown to be secreted in exosomes. Protein aggregation disorders have been linked to age-related declines in molecular chaperones and co-chaperones. Cdc37 also appears to be a potential agent in longevity due to its links to protein folding and autophagy, and it will be informative to study the role of Cdc37 maintenance/decline in aging organisms."

Fn OMVs' effects on migration after blocking autophagic flux by autophagy inhibitors were determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Fn OMVs were structurally similar to vesicles. In the in vivo experiment, Fn OMVs promoted lung metastasis in tumour-bearing mice, while chloroquine (CHQ, an autophagy inhibitor) treatment reduced the number of pulmonary metastases resulting from the intratumoral Fn OMV injection. Fn OMVs promoted the migration and invasion of cancer cells in vivo, leading to altered expression levels of EMT-related proteins (E-cadherin downregulation; Vimentin/N-cadherin upregulation).

Of note, cancer EVs play crucial roles in immunosuppression, immune evasion, and immunotherapy resistance. Thus, cancer EVs change hot tumors into cold ones. Moreover, cancer EVs affect nonimmune cells to promote cellular transformation, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), chemoresistance, tumor matrix production, destruction of biological barriers, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastatic niche formation."

They give cancer cells tools to ensure their own survival by interfering with the signaling pathways involved in senescence, anoikis, and autophagy. They can also directly promote primary tumor growth and metastasis, and endow tumor cells with mechanisms to evade myelosuppression, thus acquiring drug resistance. In this review, recent studies on the role fibrinolytic factors play in metastasis and controlling cell-death-associated processes are presented, along with studies that describe how cancer cells have exploited plasminogen receptors to escape myelosuppression."

Despite the availability of preventative, diagnostic and treatment methods including endoscopic treatment, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, biologics, salvage therapy and immunotherapy, the mortality rate associated with CRC remains alarming. Consequently, there is a pressing need to search for medicines for the treatment of CRC. Phytomedicines have been shown to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of CRC through various mechanisms, including immune regulation, modulation of gut microbiota, targeting of stem cells, macrophage polarisation, glycolysis, ferroptosis induction, modulation of extracellular vesicles, activation of mitochondria-induced apoptosis, inflammation reduction, oxidative stress management and intervention of autophagy. Furthermore, numerous studies have reported the anti-cancer and anti-metastatic effects of various phytomedicines, including curcumin, resveratrol, berberine, shikonin, dihydroartemisinin, fucoidan, luteolin, andrographolide, piperine, kaempferol, emodin, cannabidiol, tanshinone IIA and evodiamine.

In order to adapt to a hostile environment, the cancer cells rely on multiple mechanisms including immune escape, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, extravasation, autophagy, exosome release among others. Cancer cells depute their internal and external warriors, autophagosomes and exosomes, to dwell in the belligerent tumor microenvironment. It is quite reasonable for a cancer cell, striving to survive, to invest in pathways that will provide the maximum advantage. Autophagy is an important cellular degradation pathway, while the exosome pathway provides an alternative cargo disposal mechanism to maintain the homeostasis and cell survival. While autophagic degradation provides the essential nutrients to rapidly dividing cells, exosomal secretion ensures that the tumor microenvironment is attuned to accommodate the swiftly expanding tumor mass. Studies have revealed that exosomes secreted by cancer cells can modulate autophagy in recipient cells, while autophagy can influence the biogenesis of exosomes. Autophagy and exosome crosstalk is extremely complex and it is only beginning to be recognized and documented. This review is focused on discussing the roles of autophagy and exosomes in the cancer cell's adaptation to the tumor microenvironment and how the two pathways are coordinately regulated to facilitate cancer cell survival."

In this regard, the link between autophagy and exosomes is complex, bidirectional, and highly dependent on the cellular context. Interestingly, both processes have been extensively implicated in cancer pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. This review updates our understanding of how exosomes can participate in cancer development and progression, with a specific focus on their influence on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Additionally, the interplay between these extracellular vesicles and autophagy is minutely reviewed and discussed, as we hypothesize that this crosstalk may hold valuable clues for biomarker discovery and the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

These hypoxic tumor-derived exosomes are, crucially, involved in the interaction of cancer cells with their microenvironment, facilitating not only immune evasion, but increased cell growth and survival, enhanced angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), therapeutic resistance, autophagy, pre-metastasis, and metastasis. This paper explores the tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling effects of hypoxic tumor-derived exosome towards facilitating the tumor progression process, particularly, the modulatory role of these factors on tumor cell immune evasion through suppression of immune cells, expression of surface recognition molecules, and secretion of antitumor soluble factor. Tumor-expressed exosomes educate immune effector cells, including macrophages, monocytes, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), γδ T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), mast cells, and B cells, within the hypoxic TME through the release of factors that regulate their recruitment, phenotype, and function. Thus, both hypoxia and tumor-derived exosomes modulate immune cells, growth factors, cytokines, receptor molecules, and other soluble factors, which, together, collaborate to form the immune-suppressive milieu of the tumor environment. Exploring the contribution of exosomal cargos, such as RNAs and proteins, as indispensable players in the cross-talk within the hypoxic tumor microenvironmental provides a potential target for antitumor immunity or subverting immune evasion and enhancing tumor therapies."

Namely, the targeted treatment of BC, for the most part, relies on the expression of growth factors and hormone receptors by these cancer cells. Despite this, close to 30% of BC patients may experience relapse due to the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) consisting of surviving disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) from the primary tumour which can colonise a secondary site. This can lead to either detectable metastasis or DTCs entering a dormant state for a prolonged period where they are undetectable. In the latter, cells can re-emerge from their dormant state due to intrinsic and microenvironmental cues leading to relapse and metastatic outgrowth. Pre- and clinical studies propose that targeting dormant DTCs may inhibit metastasis, but the choice between keeping them dormant or forcing their ""awakening"" is still controversial. This review will focus on cancer cells' microenvironmental cues and metabolic and molecular properties, which lead to dormancy, relapse, and metastatic latency in BC. Furthermore, we will focus on the role of autophagy, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), miRNAs, and exosomes in influencing the induction of dormancy and awakening of dormant BC cells. In addition, we have analysed BC treatment from a viewpoint of autophagy, lncRNAs, miRNAs, and exosomes.

Low flow regimes observed in veins partially reroute internalized tEVs toward non-acidic and non-degradative Rab14-positive endosomes, at the expense of lysosomes, suggesting that endothelial mechanosensing diverts tEVs from degradation.

Conversely, necroptosis-elicited inflammation by cancer cells can fuel tumor growth. Recently, necroptosis-independent functions of MLKL were unraveled in receptor internalization, ligand-receptor degradation, endosomal trafficking, extracellular vesicle formation, autophagy, nuclear functions, axon repair, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and inflammasome regulation.

Here, we discuss current knowledge and controversies on MLKL, its structure, necroptosis-independent functions, expression, mutations, and its potential role as a pro- or anti-cancerous factor. Analysis of MLKL expression patterns reveals that MLKL is upregulated by type I/II interferon, conditions of inflammation, and tissue injury.

Lysosomes also mediate different forms of regulated cell death by permeabilization of the lysosomal membrane and release of their content to the cytosol. In cancer cells, lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy are increased to support the increased metabolism and allow growth even under nutrient- and oxygen-poor conditions. Tumor cells also induce exocytosis of lysosomal content to the extracellular space to promote invasion and metastasis.

The use of exosomes as a biological carrier in targeted therapy has been demonstrated. However, there may be a specific, unknown switch for loading drugs. This review focuses on the mechanisms of exosome biogenesis, release, and uptake. We also review the promotion of tumor development by exosomal ncRNAs including chemotherapy resistance, metastasis and the prospective use of exosomes in cancer diagnosis and treatment."

Whereas, the secreted vesicles so-called extracellular vesicles facilitate the transport of biomolecules, for example, nucleic acids, proteins and lipids between cells. Vesicles can be formed during the process of endocytosis or/and autophagy and not only act as mediators of intra- and inter-cellular communication but also represent pathological conditions of cells or tissues. In this review, we searched articles in PubMed, published between 2000 and 2020, with following terms: autophagy, autophagocytosis, transport vesicles, lysosomes, endosomes, exocytosis, exosomes, alone or in different combinations. The biological functions that were selected based on relevancy to our topic include cellular homeostasis and tumorigenesis. The searched literature shows that there is a high degree of synergies between exosome biogenesis and autophagy, which encompass endocytosis and endosomes, lysosomes, exocytosis and exosomes, autophagocytosis, autophagosomes and amphisomes. These transport systems not only maintain cellular homeostasis but also operate synergically against fluctuations in the external and internal environment such as during tumorigenesis and metastasis. Additionally, exosomal and autophagic proteins may serve as cancer diagnosis approaches. Exosomal and autophagy pathways play pivotal roles in homeostasis and metastasis of tumor cells. Understanding the crosstalk between endomembrane organelles and vesicular trafficking may expand our insight into cooperative functions of exosomal and autophagy pathways during disease progression and may help to develop effective therapies against lysosomal diseases including cancers and beyond."

They maintain mitochondrial quality control (MQC) by clearing damaged mitochondrial components, thereby ensuring the normal functioning of cellular processes. This process is crucial for cell survival and health, as mitochondria are the energy factories of cells, and their damage can cause cellular dysfunction and even death. Recent studies have shown that MDVs not only maintain mitochondrial health but also have a significant impact on tumour progression. MDVs selectively encapsulate and transport damaged mitochondrial proteins under oxidative stress and reduce the adverse effects of mitochondrial damage on cells, which may promote the survival and proliferation of tumour cells. Furthermore, it has been indicated that after cells experience mild stress, the number of MDVs significantly increases within 2-6 h, whereas mitophagy, a process of clearing damaged mitochondria, occurs 12-24 h later. This suggests that MDVs play a critical role in the early stress response of cells. Moreover, MDVs also have a significant role in intercellular communication, specifically in the tumour microenvironment. They can carry and transmit various bioactive molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which regulate tumour cell's growth, invasion, and metastasis. This intercellular communication may facilitate tumour spread and metastasis, making MDVs a potential therapeutic target. Advances in MDV research have identified novel biomarkers, clarified regulatory mechanisms, and provided evidence for clinical use. These breakthroughs pave the way for novel MDV-targeted therapies, offering improved treatment alternatives for cancer patients. Further research can identify MDVs' role in tumour development and elucidate future cancer treatment horizons."

Recently, animal models and an increasing set of clinical trials highlight the crucial impact of the gut and tumor microbiome on treatment response. The intestinal microbiome contributes to cancer initiation, progression, and formation of distant metastasis. In addition, tumor-associated microbiota is considered a critical player in influencing tumor microenvironments and regulating local immune processes. Intriguingly, numerous studies have successfully identified pathogens within the gut and tumor microbiome that might be linked to a poor response to different therapeutic modalities. The unfavorable microbial composition with the presence of specific microbes participates in cancer resistance and progression via several mechanisms, including upregulation of oncogenic pathways, macrophage polarization reprogramming, metabolism of chemotherapeutic compounds, autophagy pathway modulation, enhanced DNA damage repair, inactivation of a proapoptotic cascade, and bacterial secretion of extracellular vesicles, promoting the processes in the metastatic cascade. Targeted elimination of specific intratumoral bacteria appears to enhance treatment response. However, broad-spectrum antibiotic pretreatment is mostly connected to reduced efficacy due to gut dysbiosis and lower diversity. Mounting evidence supports the potential of microbiota modulation by probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation to improve intestinal dysbiosis and increase microbial diversity, leading to enhanced treatment efficacy while mitigating adverse effects. In this context, further research concerning the identification of clinically relevant microbiome signatures followed by microbiota-targeted strategies presents a promising approach to overcoming immunotherapy and chemotherapy resistance in refractory patients, improving their outcomes."

In vitro results showed that IMTP-exosomes could be internalized by hypoxia-injured H9C2 cells more efficiently than blank-exosomes. Compared with blank-exosomes, IMTP-exosomes were observed to be increasingly accumulated in ischemic heart area ( P<0.05). Meanwhile, attenuated inflammation and apoptosis, reduced fibrosis, enhanced vasculogenesis, and cardiac function were detected by mesenchymal stem cell-derived IMTP-exosome treatment in ischemic heart area.

This study investigates the protective effects of hNSC derived exosomes (hNSC-Exos) on neuronal damage. Using a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo and OS-induced HT22 cells in vitro. Firstly, our research group independently isolated human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and subsequently prepared hNSC-Exos. In vivo, MCAO rats were restored to blood flow perfusion to simulate ischemia-reperfusion injury, and hNSC-Exos were injected through stereotaxic injection into the brain. Subsequently, the protective effects of hNSC-Exos on MCAO rats were evaluated, including histological studies, behavioral assessments. In vivo, H Administration of hNSC-Exos significantly ameliorated brain tissue damage and enhanced behavioral outcomes in MCAO rats. This treatment led to a reduction in brain tissue apoptosis and facilitated the normalization of impaired neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Notably, the application of hNSC-Exos in vitro resulted in an upregulation of mitophagy in HT22 cells, thereby remedying mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrate that hNSC-Exos activate mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway, improving mitochondrial function and reducing neuronal apoptosis.

Extracellular vesicles from human cardiosphere-derived cells (CDC-EVs) enhance Treg proliferation and IL-10 production, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we focused on BCYRN1, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) highly abundant in CDC-EVs, and its role in Treg function. BCYRN1 acts as a ""microRNA sponge,"" inhibiting miR-138, miR-150, and miR-98. Suppression of these miRs leads to increased Treg proliferation via ATG7-dependent autophagy, CCR6-dependent Treg migration, and enhanced Treg IL-10 production. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, CDC-EVs, particularly those overexpressing BCYRN1, were cardioprotective, reducing infarct size and troponin I levels even when administered after reperfusion. Underlying the cardioprotection, we verified that CDC-EVs overexpressing BCYRN1 increased cardiac Treg infiltration, proliferation, and IL-10 production in vivo. These salutary effects were negated when BCYRN1 levels were reduced in CDC-EVs or when Tregs were depleted systemically. Thus, we have identified BCYRN1 as a booster of Treg number and bioactivity, rationalizing its cardioprotective efficacy.

However, the biological role of MSCs derived-exosomes in the protection of myocardial I/R injury has not been elucidated. In this study, we isolated and characterized MSCs from the bone marrow of rats femur and tibia. H9c2 cells were administrated to established the cellular hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model, and co-cultured with MSCs and MSCs-derived exosomes. Functional experiments revealed that MSCs and MSCs-derived exosomes inhibited H/R-induced cell apoptosis and cell autophagy. Interestingly, rapamycin as an activator of autophagy reversed the positive effects of MSCs-derived exosomes, while 3-methyladenine (3-MA) as autophagy inhibitor further promoted the effects of MSCs-derived exosomes, indicating MSCs exerted its function on H/R injury by mediating autophagy. Subsequently, we found that CHK2-Beclin2 pathway participated in H/R-induced autophagy. Mechanistically, miR-143-3p directly targeted CHK2 and negatively regulated CHK2 expression. Moreover, repression of exosomal miR-143-3p promoted H/R-induced autophagy via CHK2-Beclin2 pathway. Consistent with the results of in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments confirmed that exosomal miR-143-3p effectively reduced cell apoptosis by regulating autophagy via CHK2-Beclin2 pathway.

This study aimed to examine the impact of Sirt6-overexpressing exosomes derived from adipose stem cells (S-ASC-Exo) on MIRI, focusing on their influence on AIM2-pyroptosis and mitophagy processes. The sirtuin family of proteins, particularly Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6), play a pivotal role in these processes. This study aimed to explore the potential therapeutic effects of Sirt6-enriched exosomes derived from adipose stem cells (S-ASC-Exo) on regulating MIRI. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant downregulation of Sirt6 in MIRI subjected to control group, causing a consequential increase in mitophagy and pyroptosis regulator expressions. Therefore, our study revealed that Sirt6-enriched exosomes influenced the progression of MIRI through the regulation of target proteins AIM2 and GSDMD, associated with pyroptosis, and p62 and Beclin-1, related to mitophagy. The introduction of S-ASC-Exo inhibited AIM2-pyroptosis while enhancing mitophagy. Consequently, this led to a significant reduction of GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis in endothelial cells, catalyzing a deceleration in the progression of atherosclerosis. Extensive in vivo and in vitro assays were performed to validate the expressions of these specific genes and proteins, which affirmed the dynamic modulation by Sirt6-enriched exosomes. Furthermore, treatment with S-ASC-Exo drastically ameliorated cardiac functions and limited infarct size, underlining their cardioprotective attributes. Our study underscores the potential therapeutic role of Sirt6-enriched exosomes in managing MIRI. We demonstrated their profound cardioprotective effect, evident in the enhanced cardiac function and attenuated tissue damage, through the strategic modulation of AIM2-pyroptosis and mitophagy. Given the intricate interplay between Sirt6 and the aforementioned processes, a comprehensive understanding of these pathways is essential to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of Sirt6. Altogether, our findings indicate the promise of Sirt6-enriched exosomes as a novel therapeutic strategy in treating ischemia-reperfusion injuries and cardiovascular diseases at large.

Initially, a gain-of-function study was performed to investigate the function of SDF1 in ischemic myocardial cells and cardiac endothelial cells. Coculture experiments were performed to measure potential exosomic transfer of SDF1 from MSCs to ischemic myocardial cells and cardiac endothelial cells. During the coculture experiments, exosome secretion was disrupted by neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869 and upregulated exosomal SDF1 using SDF1 plasmid. Effects of Exo-SDF1 on cardiac function in MI mice were investigated in vivo. MSCs suppressed myocardial cell apoptosis and promoted microvascular regeneration of endothelial cells through secretion of exosomes.

High-speed centrifugation was used to extract HUCMSC-EXO, and the shape of the exosomes was examined using transmission electron microscopy. Immunoblotting was used to determine the expression of CD9, CD63, and TSG101 molecules on the surface of the exosomes.

As paracrine factors, neutrophil- and macrophage-derived EVs exert immunosuppressive and immune-stimulating effects on dendritic cells, respectively. Dendritic cell-derived EVs mediate alloantigen spreading and modulate antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. At systemic level, EVs exert pleiotropic effects on complement and coagulation. Depending on their biogenesis, they can amplify complement activation or shed complement inhibitors and prevent cell lysis.

Kidney endothelial- and tubular-derived EVs play a key role in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and during the healing process; additionally, they can trigger rejection by inducing both alloimmune and autoimmune responses. Endothelial EVs have procoagulant/pro-inflammatory effects and can release sequestered self-antigens, generating a tissue-specific autoimmunity. Renal tubule-derived EVs shuttle pro-fibrotic mediators (TGF-β and miR-21) to interstitial fibroblasts and modulate neutrophil and T-lymphocyte influx.

Mesenchymal stem cells derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are of great potential for immune modulation by reprogramming macrophages but their therapeutic efficacy is hindered by insufficient targeting ability in vivo. Herein, we introduced the platelet membrane modified EVs (P-EVs) based on membrane fusion method to mimic the binding ability of platelets to monocytes. In the mouse model of MI/R injury, the intravenously injected P-EVs were mainly carried by circulating monocytes into the ischemic myocardium. In the inflammatory microenvironment, those monocytes subsequently differentiated into macrophages with enhanced phagocytosis, which probably promoted in-situ endocytosis of the superficial P-EVs by monocytes differentiated macrophages in large quantities. Then, the P-EVs successfully escaped from the macrophage lysosome and released the functional microRNAs (miRNAs) into the cytosol which facilitated the inflammatory macrophages (M1 phenotype) reprogramming to reparative macrophages (M2 phenotype). Finally, the immune microenvironment was regulated to realize cardiac repair. Thus, we supposed that the most likely delivery method was that monocytes mediated P-EVs migration into ischemic myocardium where P-EVs were mainly in-situ endocytosed by monocytes derived macrophages, which holds potential for immunoregulation on MI/R and other immune-related diseases in the future."

Hotspots and developmental trends in MI/R research are being rapidly updated. However, there has been no bibliometric analysis that systematically evaluates existing literature on MI/R injury. Our study explores developments in MI/R research over the past decade, and provides a reference for future research. Both experimental and clinical publications on MI/R injury from 2012 to 2021 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The CiteSpace and VOSviewer tools were used to perform a bibliometric analysis. A total of 8419 papers were analyzed. The number of annual publications demonstrated an overall upward trend, rising from 629 publications in 2012 to 1024 publications in 2021. China, the USA, Germany, England, and Italy were the top five contributors to MI/R studies. The Fourth Military Medical University in China contributed the most publications (188, 2.23%), while the University College London in England cooperated the most with relevant research institutions. Derek J Hausenloy (University College London), Derek M Yellon (University College London), and Gerd Heusch (University of Essen Medical School) were the top three most active and influential scholars according to the H-index. Among the top 10 journals with the most publications, Basic Research in Cardiology had the highest impact factors. The top three co-cited journals were Circulation, Circulation Research, and Cardiovascular Research.

The object of the present study is to investigate whether hucMSC-exosomes have therapeutic effects on CVB3-induced myocarditis (VMC). HucMSC-exosomes were identified using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western blot. The purified hucMSC-exosomes tagged with PKH26 were tail intravenously injected into VMC model mice in vivo and used to administrate CVB3-infected human cardiomyocytes (HCMs) in vitro, respectively. The effects of hucMSC-exosomes on myocardial pathology injury, proinflammatory cytokines and cardiac function were evaluated through haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Doppler echocardiography. The anti-apoptosis role and potential mechanism of hucMSC-exosomes were explored using TUNEL staining, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, Ad-mRFP-GFP-LC3 transduction and Western blot. In vivo results showed that hucMSC-exosomes (50 μg iv) significantly alleviated myocardium injury, shrank the production of proinflammatory cytokines and improved cardiac function. Moreover, in vitro data showed that hucMSC-exosomes (50 μg/mL) inhibited the apoptosis of CVB3-infected HCM through increasing pAMPK/AMPK ratio and up-regulating autophagy proteins LC3II/I, BECLIN-1 and anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2 as well as decreasing pmTOR/mTOR ratio, promoting the degradation of autophagy flux protein P62 and down-regulating apoptosis protein BAX. In conclusion, hucMSC-exosomes could alleviate CVB3-induced myocarditis via activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy flux pathway to attenuate cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which will be benefit for MSC-exosome therapy of myocarditis in the future."

To identify whether miR-93-5p-encapsulating exosomes that form ADSCs have a better cardio-protective effect, we investigated the inflammatory factors and miR-30d-5p expression in clinical levels. A rat model of AMI and an in vitro model of hypoxic H9c2 cells were established to study the protective mechanism of miR-93-5p in ischemia-induced cardiac injury. The results show that the expression of inflammatory cytokines and miR-93-5p were increased following AMI in both patients and animal models. Moreover, treatment with ADSC-derived miR-93-5p-containing exosomes has a greater protective effect on infarction-induced myocardial damage than simple exosome processing. Furthermore, in vitro experiments confirmed that the expression of miR-93-5p can significantly suppress hypoxia-induced autophagy and inflammatory cytokine expression by targeting Atg7 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), respectively, and was confirmed with Atg7 or TLR4 overexpression. The results also show that autophagy activation can promote inflammatory cytokine expression indirectly. Taken together, these results suggest that the miR-93-5p-enhanced ADSC-derived exosomes prevent cardiac injury by inhibiting autophagy and the inflammatory response."

Apart from capturing freely released mitochondria from donor cells, stem cells are able to receive mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), gap junctional channels (GJCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially when undergoing stressful conditions such as inflammation, hypoxia, chemotherapy drug exposure, and irradiation. Stem cells that are potentiated by exogenous mitochondria show enhanced potential for proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation. The well-tolerated nature of either autogenous or allogenous mitochondria when locally injected in the human ischemic heart has validated the safety and therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation. In children diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA deletion syndrome, functional improvements have been observed when empowering their hematopoietic stem cells with maternally derived mitochondria. Apart from the widely investigated applications of mitochondrial transfer in ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative diseases and mitochondrial diseases etc., therapeutic potentials of mitochondrial transfer in tissue repair and regeneration are equally noteworthy, though there has been no systematic summary in this regard.This review analyzed the research and development trends of mitochondrial transfer in stem cells and regenerative medicine over the past decade from a bibliometric perspective, introduced the concept and associated mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer, summarized the regulations of intercellular mitochondrial transfer on stem cell fate. Finally, the therapeutic application of mitochondrial transplantation in diseases and tissue regeneration has been reviewed, including recent clinical studies related to mitochondrial transplantation.Mitochondrial transfer shows promise in modifying and reshaping the cellular properties of stem cells, making them more conducive to regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived mitochondria have shown multifaceted potential in promoting the revitalization and regeneration of cardiac, cutaneous, muscular, neuronal tissue. This review integrates novel research findings on mitochondrial transfer in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, emphasizing the crucial translational value of mitochondrial transfer in regeneration. It serves to underscore the significant impact of mitochondrial transfer and provides a valuable reference for further exploration in this field."

Although the primary causes of AD are not clear, it is widely accepted that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and consecutive hyper-phosphorylation of tau, synaptic loss, oxidative stress and neuronal death might play a vital role in AD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been widely suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are released from virtually all cell types, are a mediator in regulating AD pathogenesis. Clinical evidence for the diagnostic performance of EV-associated biomarkers, particularly exosome biomarkers in the blood, is also emerging. In this review, we briefly introduce the biological function of EVs in the central nervous system and discuss the roles of EVs in AD pathogenesis. In particular, the roles of EVs associated with autophagy and lysosomal degradation systems in AD proteinopathy and in disease propagation are discussed. Next, we summarize candidates for biochemical AD biomarkers in EVs, including proteins and miRNAs. The accumulating data brings hope that the application of EVs will be helpful for early diagnostics and the identification of new therapeutic targets for AD. However, at the same time, there are several challenges in developing valid EV biomarkers. We highlight considerations for the development of AD biomarkers from circulating EVs, which includes the standardization of pre-analytical sources of variability, yield and purity of isolated EVs and quantification of EV biomarkers. The development of valid EV AD biomarkers may be facilitated by collaboration between investigators and the industry."

Recently, exosomes have been reported to have mitochondrial regulatory potential and antineurodegenerative properties. This review presents the mitochondrial abnormalities in brain cells associated with AD and PD and the potential of exosomes to treat these diseases. Specifically, it recapitulates research on the molecular mechanisms whereby exosomes regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion/fission dynamics, mitochondrial transport, and mitophagy.

We thus hypothesized that blocking HIF-1α could likely mitigate HIV-1 Tat-ADEV-mediated neuronal injury. Rat hippocampal neurons when exposed to HIV-1 Tat-ADEVs carrying the toxic amyloids exhibited amyloid accumulation and synaptodendritic injury, leading to functional loss as evidenced by alterations in miniature excitatory post synaptic currents.

As critical inflammatory cells, exosomes secreted by microglia have been found to affect the spread of pathologic proteins and neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of microglial exosomes on neuroinflammation and cognitive outcomes after intermittent hypoxia remain unclear. In this study, the role of miRNAs in microglial exosomes in improving cognitive deficits in mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia was investigated. We demonstrated that miR-146a-5p fluctuated over time in microglial exosomes of mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia for different periods of time, which could regulate neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome and neuroinflammation. In primary neurons, we found that miR-146a-5p regulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by targeting HIF1α, thus affecting the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of inflammatory factors. Similarly, further studies showed that inhibition of NLRP3 by administering overexpressed miR-146a-5p in microglial exosomes and MCC950 has improved neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in mice after intermittent hypoxia.

Goals were to provide in-depth analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), characterize patient-to-patient heterogeneity, and identify candidate biomarkers. We identified 752 ALS-increased and 764 ALS-decreased DEGs (FDR < 0.10 with > 10% expression change). Gene expression shifts in ALS blood broadly resembled acute high altitude stress responses. ALS-increased DEGs had high exosome expression, were neutrophil-specific, associated with translation, and overlapped significantly with genes near ALS susceptibility loci (e.g., IFRD1, TBK1, CREB5). ALS-decreased DEGs, in contrast, had low exosome expression, were erythroid lineage-specific, and associated with anemia and blood disorders. Genes encoding neurofilament proteins (NEFH, NEFL) had poor diagnostic accuracy (50-53%). However, support vector machines distinguished ALS patients from ALS mimics and controls with 87% accuracy (sensitivity: 86%, specificity: 87%). Expression profiles were heterogeneous among patients and we identified two subgroups: (i) patients with higher expression of IL6R and myeloid lineage-specific genes and (ii) patients with higher expression of IL23A and lymphoid-specific genes. The gene encoding copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) was most strongly associated with survival (HR = 0.77; P = 1.84e-05) and other survival-associated genes were linked to mitochondrial respiration. We identify a 61 gene signature that significantly improves survival prediction when added to Cox proportional hazard models with baseline clinical data (i.e., age at onset, site of onset and sex). Predicted median survival differed 2-fold between patients with favorable and risk-associated gene expression signatures. Peripheral blood analysis informs our understanding of ALS disease mechanisms and genetic association signals. Our findings are consistent with low-grade neutrophilia and hypoxia as ALS phenotypes, with heterogeneity among patients partly driven by differences in myeloid and lymphoid cell abundance.

Results show that DJ-1, which is rich in Hypo-EVs, alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production as an antioxidant. Mechanistic studies demonstrate for the first time that DJ-1 may suppress cardiac hypertrophy by inhibiting the activity of proteasome subunit beta type 10 (PSMB10) through a direct physical interaction. This interaction can inhibit angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-mediated signaling pathways resulting in cardiac hypertrophy through alleviating ubiquitination degradation of AT1R-associated protein (ATRAP).

The primary cause of late-onset AD remains unknown although its pathology was discovered over a century ago. Recently, the vascular hypothesis of AD has received backing from evidence emerging from neuroimaging studies which have revealed the presence of a significant hypoperfusion in the brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology. In fact, hypoxia can explain many of the pathological changes evident in AD pathology, e.g. the deposition of β-amyloid plaques and chronic low-grade inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) stimulates inflammatory responses and modulates both innate and adaptive immunity. It is known that hypoxia-induced inflammation evokes compensatory anti-inflammatory response involving tissue-resident microglia/macrophages and infiltrated immune cells. Hypoxia/HIF-1α induce immunosuppression by (i) increasing the expression of immunosuppressive genes, (ii) stimulating adenosinergic signaling, (iii) enhancing aerobic glycolysis, i.e. lactate production, and (iv) augmenting the secretion of immunosuppressive exosomes. Interestingly, it seems that these common mechanisms are also involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In AD pathology, an enhanced immunosuppression appears, e.g. as a shift in microglia/macrophage phenotypes towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and an increase in the numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg). The augmented anti-inflammatory capacity promotes the resolution of acute inflammation but persistent inflammation has crucial effects not only on immune cells but also harmful responses to the homeostasis of AD brain. I will examine in detail the mechanisms of the hypoperfusion/hypoxia-induced immunosuppressive state in general and especially, in its association with AD pathogenesis. These immunological observations support the vascular hypothesis of AD pathology."

Murine brain vesicle profiles were then analyzed in parallel with brain EVs from post-mortem subjects affected by preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and mixed dementias. Brain EVs were identified with molecular mediators of hypoxia responses, neuroprotection and neurotoxicity in BCAS mice, patterns also partially resembled by subjects with preclinical AD and mixed dementias.

Here, we aimed to determine whether the combination of EPC-EXs and miR-210 would provide an enhanced protective effect on neurons. The hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) model were applied to neurons to mimic the ischemic injury of neurons.

Herein, our study illustrated that hypoxic NK cells-derived exosomes ameliorated AD progression by delivering hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Specifically, AD models APP/PS1 mice and β-amyloid (Aβ)-treated HT22 cells were subjected to exosomes from NK cells cultured under normoxic (Nor-exo) or hypoxic (Hyp-exo) conditions. Compared to Nor-exo, Hyp-exo alleviated mice cognition damage, reduced the levels of p-Tau, P16, and P53, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) to suppress cellular senescence, downregulated Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 to suppress apoptotic cell death, and decreased MDA levels and increased GSH/GSSG ratio to initiate anti-oxidant effects in both APP/PS1 mice brain tissues and Aβ-treated HT22 cells. Moreover, antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) obviously mitigated Aβ-triggered senescence and apoptosis in HT22 cells. Interestingly, our mechanical experiments confirmed that HIF-1α was especially enriched in Hyp-exo compared to Nor-exo, and the following rescue experiments verified that Hyp-exo exerted its protective effects in AD models by delivering HIF-1α. In conclusion, Hyp-exo HIF-1α-dependently suppressed oxidative stress-related neuronal cell senescence and apoptosis to mitigate pathogenesis of AD, and our study might provide new theoretical basis for developing treatment methods for AD."

Infarct heart tissue had 2.5- to 10-fold more aggregates than non-infarct or sham-MI heart tissue (each P = 0.001). Protein constituents from MI cerebral aggregates overlapped substantially with those from human Alzheimer's disease brain. Prior injection of mice with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) exosomes, shown to limit infarct size after LCA ligation, reduced cardiac aggregation ~ 60%, and attenuated markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in heart and brain (GRP78, ATF6, P-PERK) by 50-75%. MI also elevated aggregate constituents enriched in Alzheimer's disease (AD) aggregates, such as proteasomal subunits, heat-shock proteins, complement C3, clusterin/ApoJ, and other apolipoproteins.

More importantly, exosomes from PC-MSCs effectively increased the level of miR-21 in the brain of AD mice. Additionally, replenishment of miR-21 restored the cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and prevented pathologic features. Taken together, these findings suggest that exosomes from PC-MSCs could improve the learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 mice, and that the underlying mechanism may lie in the restoration of synaptic dysfunction and regulation of inflammatory responses through regulation of miR-21.-Cui, G.-H., Wu, J., Mou, F.-F., Xie, W.-H., Wang, F.-B., Wang, Q.-L., Fang, J., Xu, Y.-W., Dong, Y.-R., Liu, J.-R., Guo, H.-D.

Acute NDs encompass conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and spinal cord injury (SCI). On the other hand, chronic NDs include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Currently, no definitive cure exists for these diseases, and available therapies focus primarily on slowing the progression of symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their multilineage differentiation capacity, immunomodulatory abilities, and regenerative properties, have gained attention in regenerative medicine. In recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from MSCs have shown great promise as a cell-free therapeutic approach, eliminating the risks associated with direct MSCs use, such as tumorigenicity and poor cell survival after transplantation. EVs have emerged as powerful mediators of intercellular communication and tissue repair, exhibiting immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and proregenerative properties. However, limitations such as low EVs yield and reduced efficacy due to MSCs replicative senescence restrict their therapeutic potential. Preconditioning strategies, including hypoxia, 3D cultures, and biochemical priming, have been explored in other fields to enhance EVs properties, yet their specific application to NDs remains under-reported. This review aims to address this gap by analyzing the preconditioning methods used to boost the therapeutic potential of MSCs-derived EVs for neurodegenerative diseases. These preconditioning strategies may enhance EVs yield, functional cargo, and targeted therapeutic efficacy for treating acute and chronic NDs."

Through the study of exosomes and their content in tau and amyloid beta (Aβ), the aim of this study was to show how exosomes could be used as biomarkers of OSAS and of their cognitive disorders. Two groups of 15 volunteers from the PROOF cohort were selected: severe apnea (AHI > 30) and control (AHI < 5). After exosome isolation from blood serum, we characterized and quantified them (CD81, CD9, CD63) by western blot and ELISAs and put them 5 h in contact with an in vitro BBB model. The apparent permeability of the BBB was measured using sodium-fluorescein and TEER. Cell ELISAs were performed on tight junctions (ZO-1, claudin-5, occludin). The amount of tau and Aβ proteins found in the exosomes was quantified using ELISAs. Compared to controls, OSAS patients had a greater quantity of exosomes, tau, and Aβ proteins in their blood sera, which induced an increase in BBB permeability in the model and was reflected by a loss of tight junction' expression. Elderly patients suffering severe OSAS released more exosomes in serum from the brain compartment than controls. Such exosomes increased BBB permeability.

We have previously shown in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model that deficiency of the molecular adaptor Rai reduces disease severity and demyelination. Moreover, using primary mouse astrocytes, we showed that Rai contributes to the generation of a pro-inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment through the production of nitric oxide and IL-6 and by impairing CD39 activity in response to soluble factors released by encephalitogenic T cells. Here, we investigated the impact of Rai expression on astrocyte function both under basal conditions and in response to IL-17 treatment using a proteomic approach.

These nanoscale vesicles contribute to corneal healing by modulating inflammation, supporting epithelial and stromal regeneration, and promoting nerve repair. Their therapeutic potential is largely attributed to the diverse and bioactive proteomic cargo they carry, including growth factors, cytokines, and proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. This review presents a comprehensive examination of the proteomic landscape of EVs in the context of corneal regenerative medicine. We explore the biological functions of EVs in corneal epithelial repair, stromal remodeling, and neurodegeneration. In addition, we discuss advanced proteomic profiling techniques such as mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which have been used to identify and characterize the protein contents of EVs. This review also compares the proteomic profiles of EVs derived from various MSC sources, including adipose tissue, bone marrow, and umbilical cord, and considers how environmental cues, such as hypoxia and inflammation, influence their protein composition.

Besides, it has been established that cells release different types of vesicular structures for which characterization is still in its infancy. Many stress conditions, such as hypoxia, senescence, and oncogene activation have been associated with the release of higher levels of EVs. Further, evidence has shown that autophagic-lysosomal pathway abnormalities also affect EV release. In fact, in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of toxic proteins, although it has not become clear to what extent the intracellular storage of undigested materials itself has beneficial/adverse effects, these proteins have also been shown to be released extracellularly via EVs. Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are characterized by accumulation of undigested substrates within the endosomal-lysosomal system, due either to genetic mutations in lysosomal proteins or to treatment with pharmacological agents. Here, we review studies investigating the role of lysosomal and autophagic dysfunction on the release of EVs, with a focus on studies exploring the release of EVs in LSD models of both genetic and pharmacological origin. A better knowledge of EV-releasing pathways activated in lysosomal stress conditions will provide information on the role of EVs in both alleviating intracellular storage of undigested materials and spreading the pathology to the neighboring tissue."

Herein, it is reported that M2 TAMs-derived exosomes induced aerobic glycolysis in gastric cancer cells and enhanced their proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance in a glycolysis-dependent manner. It is identified that MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is enriched in M2 TAM exosomes and confirmed that MALAT1 transfer from M2 TAMs to gastric cancer cells via exosomes mediates this effect. Mechanistically, MALAT1 interacted with the δ-catenin protein and suppressed its ubiquitination and degradation by β-TRCP. In addition, MALAT1 upregulated HIF-1α expression by acting as a sponge for miR-217-5p. The activation of β-catenin and HIF-1α signaling pathways by M2 TAM exosomes collectively led to enhanced aerobic glycolysis in gastric cancer cells. Finally, a dual-targeted inhibition of MALAT1 in both gastric cancer cells and macrophages by exosome-mediated delivery of siRNA remarkably suppressed gastric cancer growth and improved chemosensitivity in mouse tumor models. Taken together, these results suggest that M2 TAMs-derived exosomes promote gastric cancer progression via MALAT1-mediated regulation of glycolysis.

There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the critical role of exosomes in facilitating communication between tumor cells and TAMs, thereby contributing to the establishment of the premetastatic niche. Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms through which exosomes derived from tumor cells influence macrophage polarization under hypoxic conditions in pNENs, and the manner in which these interactions support cancer metastasis, remain largely unexplored. Recognizing the capacity of exosomes to transfer miRNAs that can modify cellular behaviors, our research identified a significant overexpression of miR-4488 in exosomes derived from hypoxic pNEN cells. Furthermore, we observed that macrophages that absorbed circulating exosomal miR-4488 underwent M2-like polarization. Our investigations revealed that miR-4488 promotes M2-like polarization by directly targeting and suppressing RTN3 in macrophages. This suppression of RTN3 enhances fatty acid oxidation and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway through the interaction and downregulation of FABP5. Additionally, M2 polarized macrophages contribute to the formation of the premetastatic niche and advance pNENs metastasis by releasing MMP2, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop involving miR-4488, RTN3, FABP5, and MMP2 in pNEN cells. Together, these findings shed light on the role of exosomal miRNAs from hypoxic pNEN cells in mediating interactions between pNEN cells and intrahepatic macrophages, suggesting that miR-4488 holds potential as a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for pNENs."

Metastatic sites are actively remodeled by secretory factors including growth factors, chemokines and cytokines, extracellular matrix (ECM) enzymes, and exosomes produced by the primary cancer tissues. Many of the associated-secretory factors are abundantly induced by inflammation and hypoxia. These secretory factors modify the ECM, immune composition, and blood vessel permeability of the future metastatic sites, a process termed 'metastatic niche formation.' In general, ECM is modified to enhance the attachment of other cell types or cancer cells to establish a growth-factor rich metastatic niche. Immune-suppressive cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) dominate the metastatic niche to allow metastatic cancer cells to bypass immune surveillance and propagate. Endothelial cell-to-cell junctions of blood vessels are loosened to enhance the penetrance of metastatic cancer cells to the metastatic sites. Different metastatic tissues have unique ECM constituents, resident immune cells, and anatomical positions linked with the circulatory system; therefore, many cancer types have their own metastatic pattern, and they favor metastasis to specific organs. Some of the remodeling events represent the earliest step of metastasis, even preceding the detachment of cancer cells from the primary tumor site. Understanding how the metastatic niche is formed is important for the development of drugs to prevent the earliest step of metastasis and advance our understanding of organotrophic metastasis. This review summarizes the major findings in the field of metastatic niche highlighting the role of hypoxia."

Many studies have suggested that exosomes are important mediators of metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune modulation in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, exosomes can be isolated from bodily fluids of cancer patients, including urine, blood, saliva, milk, tumor effusion, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid and so on. Consequently, exosomes are potential biomarkers for clinical predictions and are also good drug carriers because they can cross the biofilm without triggering an immune response.

Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms are involved in cellular metabolic memory and can determine one's predisposition to being overweight. Low-grade chronic inflammation, a well-established characteristic of obesity, is a central component of tumor development and progression. Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA), which enhance inflammation- and metastasis-related gene sets within the cancer microenvironment, have pro-tumoral effects. Adipose tissue is a major source of the exosomal micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), which modulate pathways involved in the development of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. Owing to their composition of cargo, exosomes can activate receptors at the target cell or transfer molecules to the target cells and thereby change the phenotype of these cells. Exosomes that are released into the extracellular environment are internalized with their cargo by neighboring cells. The tumor-secreted exosomes promote organ-specific metastasis of tumor cells that normally lack the capacity to metastasize to a specific organ. Therefore, the communication between neighboring cells via exosomes is defined as the ""next-cell hypothesis."" The reciprocal interaction between the adipocyte and tumor cell is realized through the adipocyte-derived exosomal miRNAs and tumor cell-derived oncogenic miRNAs. The cargo molecules of adipocyte-derived exosomes are important messengers for intercellular communication involved in metabolic responses and have very specific signatures that direct the metabolic activity of target cells. RNA-induced silencing regulates gene expression through various mechanisms. Destabilization of DICER enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), is an important checkpoint in cancer development and progression. Interestingly, adipose tissue in obesity and tumors share similar pathogenic features, and the local hypoxia progress in both. While hypoxia in obesity leads to the adipocyte dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, in obesity-related cancer cases, it is associated with worsened prognosis, increased metastatic potential, and resistance to chemotherapy.

These cells can additionally and significantly contribute to tumor and metastasis progression, especially also by acting via their own deregulated micro (mi) RNA expression or activity. Thus, miRNAs are essential players in the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME. MiRNAs are small non-coding (nc) RNAs that typically inhibit translation and stability of messenger (m) RNAs, thus being able to regulate several cell functions including proliferation, migration, differentiation, survival, invasion, and several steps of the metastatic cascade. The dynamic interplay between miRNAs in different cell types or organelles such as exosomes, ECM macromolecules, and the TME plays critical roles in many aspects of cancer development. This chapter aims to give an overview on the multiple contributions of miRNAs as players within the TME, to summarize the role of miRNAs in the crosstalk between different cell populations found within the TME, and to illustrate how they act on tumorigenesis and the behavior of cells in the TME context.

This paper explores the tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling effects of hypoxic tumor-derived exosome towards facilitating the tumor progression process, particularly, the modulatory role of these factors on tumor cell immune evasion through suppression of immune cells, expression of surface recognition molecules, and secretion of antitumor soluble factor. Tumor-expressed exosomes educate immune effector cells, including macrophages, monocytes, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), γδ T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), mast cells, and B cells, within the hypoxic TME through the release of factors that regulate their recruitment, phenotype, and function. Thus, both hypoxia and tumor-derived exosomes modulate immune cells, growth factors, cytokines, receptor molecules, and other soluble factors, which, together, collaborate to form the immune-suppressive milieu of the tumor environment. Exploring the contribution of exosomal cargos, such as RNAs and proteins, as indispensable players in the cross-talk within the hypoxic tumor microenvironmental provides a potential target for antitumor immunity or subverting immune evasion and enhancing tumor therapies."

Oleanolic acid (OA) was intragastrically administered to TDEs-preconditioned mice. Bioinformatics analysis and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays were performed to identify targets of OA in fibroblasts. H-TDEs induced activation of pulmonary fibroblasts, promoted formation of pulmonary PMN and subsequently facilitated lung metastasis of HCC.

Under hypoxia, tumor cells reshape their microenvironment to sustain survival, promote metastasis, and develop resistance to therapy. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by most eukaryotic cells, including tumor cells. They are enriched with a selective collection of nucleic acids and proteins from the originating cells to mediate cell-to-cell communication. Accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes derived from tumor cells play critical roles in modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME). Hypoxia is known to stimulate the secretion of exosomes from tumor cells, thereby promoting intercellular communication of hypoxic tumors with the surrounding stromal tissues. Exosome-mediated signaling pathways under hypoxic conditions have been reported to cause angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and immune escape. Recently, the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) has been reported to reside as a transmembrane protein in tumor exosomes. Exosomal PD-L1 was shown to suppress T cell effector function in the TME and cause drug resistance to immune checkpoint therapy. This review provides an update about the pivotal role of tumor-derived exosomes in drug resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Emerging strategies that target the exosomes in the hypoxic TME to enhance the antitumor efficacy are discussed."

Mesenchymal stem cells are a class of cells with the potential for self-healing and multidirectional differentiation. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that EVs, especially those secreted by mesenchymal stem cells, can promote the repair and regeneration of various tissues and, thus, have significant potential in regenerative medicine. However, due to the rapid clearance capacity of the circulatory system, EVs are barely able to act persistently at specific sites for repair of target tissues. Hydrogels have good biocompatibility and loose and porous structural properties that allow them to serve as EV carriers, thereby prolonging the retention in certain specific areas and slowing the release of EVs. When EVs are needed to function at specific sites, the EV-loaded hydrogels can stand as an excellent approach. In this review, we first introduce the sources, roles, and extraction and characterization methods of EVs and describe their current application status. We then review the different types of hydrogels and discuss factors influencing their abilities to carry and release EVs. We summarize several strategies for loading EVs into hydrogels and characterizing EV-loaded hydrogels.

RNA-sequence data was used to identify EV circRNAs that were involved into endogenous cardiac regeneration. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions were conducted to determine circRNA expression in tissue, cells and EVs. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to explore the function of EV-derived circWhsc1 during cardiac regeneration. Western blotting and RNA pulldown assays were used to investigate its underlying mechanism. We found that circWhsc1 was enriched in neonatal mouse hearts, particularly in cardiac ECs, and was further upregulated both in ECs and EC-derived EVs under hypoxic conditions. When cocultured with hypoxia-preconditioned neonatal ECs or their secreted EVs, both neonatal and adult CMs exhibited an increased proliferation rate and G2/M ratio, which could be attenuated by knockdown of circWhsc1 in ECs. In vivo, EC-restricted overexpression of circWhsc1 and EV-mediated delivery of circWhsc1 induced CM proliferation, alleviated cardiac fibrosis and restored cardiac function following myocardial infarction in adult mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that EV-derived circWhsc1 activated TRIM59 by enhancing its phosphorylation, thereby reinforcing the binding of TRIM59 to STAT3, phosphorylating STAT3 and inducing CM proliferation.

Ligand fragments or homing peptides discovered by phage display and in vivo biopanning methods fused to the enriched molecules on the external part of exosomes have been exploited to improve the ability of exosomes to target specific tissues or organs carrying cognate receptors. Herein, we briefly elucidated how to improve targeting ability of exosomes to ischemic myocardium. Methods and Results We used technology of molecular cloning and lentivirus packaging to engineer exosomal enriched membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused with ischemic myocardium-targeting peptide CSTSMLKAC (IMTP). In vitro results showed that IMTP-exosomes could be internalized by hypoxia-injured H9C2 cells more efficiently than blank-exosomes.

However, the current use of melatonin pretreatment varies widely. Here, we discuss the effects of melatonin pretreatment on the heterogeneity of exosomes based on the role of melatonin and further speculate on the possible mechanisms. Finally, the therapeutic use of exosomes and the usage of melatonin pretreatment are described."

I-R injury can affect all organs and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Pathological settings such as myocardial infarction, stroke, hemorrhagic shock, and solid organ transplant are particularly prone to cause I-R injury. Ischemia (hypoxia) and/or reperfusion (reoxygenation) induces various forms of cellular and structural damage. A major cause of damage is local inflammatory responses, which may spread to produce more advanced systemic inflammation. Management of I-R injury relies primarily on supportive measures, as specific treatment strategies are lacking. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-secreted nano-scale structures containing various biomolecules involved in cell communication and multiple physiological processes. EVs derived from certain cell types have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and angiogenic properties. This review provides an overview of EV-based therapeutics for I-R injury in kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and brain. Additionally, the mechanisms by which EVs protect against I-R injury are discussed. Promising preclinical findings highlight the potential clinical use of EVs for I-R injury."

Exosomes can alleviate HIRI. Therefore, this study explored the role of exosomal-related genes (ERGs) in HIRI using bioinformatics to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms and novel diagnostic markers for HIRI. We merged the GSE12720, GSE14951, and GSE15480 datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database into a combined gene dataset (CGD). CGD was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on a comparison of the HIRI and healthy control cohorts. The impact of these DEGs on HIRI was assessed through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). ERGs were retrieved from the GeneCards database and prior studies, and overlapped with the identified DEGs to yield the set of exosome-related differentially expressed genes (ERDEGs). Functional annotations and enrichment pathways of these genes were determined using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Diagnostic models for HIRI were developed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Key genes with diagnostic value were identified from the overlap, and single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was conducted to evaluate the immune infiltration characteristics. A molecular regulatory interaction network was established using Cytoscape software to elucidate the intricate regulatory mechanisms of key genes in HIRI. Finally, exosome score (Es) was obtained using ssGSEA and the HIRI group was divided into the Es_High and Es_Low groups based on the median Es. Gene expression was analyzed to understand the impact of all genes in the CGD on HIRI. Finally, the relative expression levels of the five key genes in the hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 3810 DEGs were identified through differential expression analysis of the CGD, and 61 of these ERDEGs were screened. Based on GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, the ERDEGs were mainly enriched in wound healing, MAPK, protein kinase B signaling, and other pathways. GSEA and GSVA revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in the TP53, MAPK, TGF[Formula: see text], JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFKB pathways. Five key genes (ANXA1, HNRNPA2B1, ICAM1, PTEN, and THBS1) with diagnostic value were screened using the LASSO regression and SVM algorithms and their molecular interaction network was established using Cytoscape software. Based on ssGSEA, substantial variations were found in the expression of 18 immune cell types among the groups (p < 0.05). Finally, the Es of each HIRI patient was calculated. ERDEGs in the Es_High and Es_Low groups were enriched in the IL18, TP53, MAPK, TGF[Formula: see text], and JAK-STAT pathways. The differential expression of these five key genes in the H/R model was verified using qRT-PCR. Herein, five key genes were identified as potential diagnostic markers. Moreover, the potential impact of these genes on pathways and the regulatory mechanisms of their interaction network in HIRI were revealed. Altogether, our findings may serve as a theoretical foundation for enhancing clinical diagnosis and elucidating underlying pathogeneses."

However, the cardioprotective benefits of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC)-Exos remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of exosomes from ADSC on the hearts of MI-treated mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Cellular and molecular mechanisms were investigated using cultured ADSCs. On C57BL/6J mice, we performed myocardial MI or sham operations and assessed cardiac function, fibrosis, and angiogenesis 4 weeks later. Mice were intramyocardially injected with ADSC-Exos or vehicle-treated ADSCs after 25 min following the MI operation. Echocardiographic experiments showed that ADSC-Exos could significantly improve left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas ADSC-Exos administration could significantly alleviate MI-induced cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, ADSC-Exos treatment has been shown to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis while increasing angiogenesis. Molecular experiments found that exosomes extracted from ADSCs can promote the proliferation and migration of microvascular endothelial cells, facilitate angiogenesis, and inhibit cardiomyocytes apoptosis through miRNA-205. We then transferred isolated exosomes from ADSCs into MI-induced mice and observed decreased cardiac fibrosis, increased angiogenesis, and improved cardiac function. We also observed increased apoptosis and decreased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor in HMEC-1 transfected with a miRNA-205 inhibitor. In summary, these findings show that ADSC-Exos can alleviate cardiac injury and promote cardiac function recovery in MI-treated mice via the miRNA-205 signaling pathway.

Interestingly, direct cardiac injection of MSC exosomes reduced infarct size and improved heart function after coronary ligation. In vitro, the MSC exosomes enhanced cardiomyocyte survival to hypoxia. Confirmation of exosome uptake in myocytes was confirmed. Dual-luciferase reporter assay implicated miR-210 as a mediator of the therapeutic effect and AIFM3 as a downstream target.

HL-1 cells were used to analyze the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. An MI mouse model was constructed and the therapeutic effect of Exos was determined using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. The results showed that HExos had a more pronounced treatment effect than ADSC Exos on cardiac damage amelioration after MI. NGS showed that circ-Stt3b plays a role in HExo-mediated cardiac damage repair after MI. Overexpression of circ-Stt3b decreased apoptosis, ROS level, and inflammatory factor expression in HL-1 cells under hypoxic conditions. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporting data validated miR-15a-5p and GPX4 as downstream circ-Stt3b targets. GPX4 downregulation or miR-15a-5p overexpression reversed protective effect regarding circ-Stt3b upon HL-1 cells after exposure to a hypoxic microenvironment. Overexpression of circ-Stt3b increased the treatment effect of ASDSC Exos on cardiac damage amelioration after MI. Taken together, the study results demonstrated that Exos from hypoxic pretreatment ADSCs ameliorate cardiac damage post-MI through circ-Stt3b/miR-15a-5p/GPX4 signaling activation and decreased ferroptosis."

Hypoxia has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the tissue repair capabilities of MSCs. However, the specific effects of hypoxia on MSCs and MSC-EVs, as well as their therapeutic potential in renal IRI, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the alterations occurring in MSCs and the production of MSC-EVs following hypoxia pre-treatment, and further explored the key intrinsic mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of hypoxic MSC-EVs in the treatment of renal IRI. Human umbilical cord MSCs were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Proliferation and related pathways were measured, and RNA sequencing was used to detect changes in the transcriptional profile. MSC-EVs from both normoxic and hypoxic conditions were isolated and characterized. In vivo, the localization and therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs were assessed in a rat renal IRI model. Histological examinations were conducted to evaluate the structure, proliferation, and apoptosis of IRI kidney tissue respectively. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. In vitro, the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs were measured in renal tubular epithelial cells injured by antimycin A. Protein sequencing analysis of hypoxic MSC-EVs was performed, and the depletion of Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 1 (GSTO1) in hypoxic MSC-EVs was carried out to verify its key role in alleviating renal injury. Hypoxia alters MSCs transcriptional profile, promotes their proliferation, and increases the production of EVs. Hypoxia-pretreated MSC-EVs demonstrated a superior ability to mitigate renal IRI, enhancing proliferation and reducing apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Protein profiling of the EVs revealed an accumulation of numerous anti-oxidative stress proteins, with GSTO1 being particularly prominent. Knockdown of GSTO1 significantly reduced the antioxidant and therapeutic effects on renal IRI of hypoxic MSC-EVs. Hypoxia significantly promotes the generation of MSC-EVs and enhances their therapeutic effects on renal IRI. The antioxidant stress effect induced by GSTO1 is identified as one of the most critical underlying mechanisms. Our findings highlight that hypoxia-pretreated MSC-EVs represent a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for renal IRI."

Cardiomyocytes H9c2 were damaged by H/R to mimic myocardial damage. Exos were gained from BMSC. The content of HAND2-AS1 and miR-17-5p was assessed by RT-qPCR. Cell survival rate and apoptosis were estimated by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of protein. The contents of LDH, SOD, and MDA in the cell culture were detected by commercial kits. The luciferase reporter gene method confirmed the targeted relationships. In H9c2 cells induced by H/R, the level of HAND2-AS1 declined and the expression of miR-17-5p was elevated, but their expression was reversed after exo treatment. Exos improved the cell viability, declined cell apoptosis, controlled the oxidative stress, and repressed inflammation, thus attenuating the damage of H9c2 induced by H/R, whereas, the knockdown of HAND2-AS1 partly alleviated the impacts of exos. MiR-17-5p played the opposite role to HAND2-AS1 on H/R-injured myocardial cells. Exos derived from BMSC could alleviate H/R-induced myocardial injury by activating HAND2-AS1/miR-17-5p/Mfn2 pathway."

Processing removed serum carrier proteins, coagulation factors and complement proteins from the original platelet lysate and the resultant SCPL-EVs carried a range of trophic factors and multiple recognised cardioprotective miRNAs. As such, SCPL-EVs protected rodent and human cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury and stimulated angiogenesis of human cardiac microvessel endothelial cells. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction with reperfusion, SCPL-EV delivery using echo-guided intracavitary percutaneous injection produced large improvements in cardiac function, reduced scar formation and promoted angiogenesis.

The neuroprotective effects of hNSC-EVs were evaluated in an in vitro neuronal H/R model. Three parameters of hNSC-EVs, structure, phenotype and particle size, were characterized. At the cellular level, a human neuron cerebral ischemic reperfusion (CIR) injury model was constructed. Cell viability, apoptosis, and the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using real-time cell analysis (RTCA), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), respectively. The neuronal axonal elongation was assessed by Opera Phenix™ screening system. The angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was evaluated by co-culturing HUVECs with hNSC-EVs in Matrigel. The expression of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related proteins in cells and the nuclear transfer of Nrf2 following hypoxia-reperfusion (H/R) was verified by Western-blotting. We found that the hNSC-EVs can promote the survival of post-H/R injury neurons, inhibit neuronal apoptosis, and enhance nuclear transfer of Nrf2, in response to oxidative stress. We also found the hNSC-EVs can promote the elongation of neuronal axons and the angiogenesis of HUVECs. At present, there is no effective therapy for CIR injury.

Little is known about whether exosomes/microvesicles mediate this beneficial effect and whether ischaemia post-conditioning (Postcon) can regulate this process. Here, we aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effect of CFs-exosomes/microvesicles and whether Postcon can regulate this effect. By using transwells co-culture system, we found that hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) significantly increased the exosomes/microvesicles secretion of CFs and CFs protected H9C2 cells against H/R injury and Postcon could amplify these effects. Inhibition of CFs exosomes/microvesicles secretion led to a significant abrogation on the amplified protective effect of H/R-Postcon. We further demonstrated that Postcon enhanced the cardioprotective effect of CFs-exosomes/microvesicles both in vitro and in vivo. To detect the underlying mechanism, exosomes/microvesicles microRNAs were analysed by RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, our results revealed that miR-423-3p expression was selectively enhanced by Postcon in CFs exosomes/microvesicles. By co-culture H9C2 cells with CFs-exosomes/microvesicles enriching with miR-423-3p, we demonstrated that H/R-Postcon exerted cardioprotective effects by upregulation of miR-423-3p in CFs-exosomes/microvesicles.

Gain- and loss-of-function approaches suggested that rescuing the down-regulated miR-423-3p might be a potential strategy to protect the cardiomyocytes against H/R. Using computational predictions tools and luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that miR-423-3p regulates the expression of Ras-related protein Rap-2c (RAP2C) in H9C2 cells, and knockdown of RAP2C by siRNA obviously increased cell viability and reduced apoptosis in H9C2 cells under H/R. In conclusion, we demonstrated, for the first time, that CFs participate in cardioprotective effects via an exosomes/microvesicles pathway during the acute phase of IRI and Postcon can enhance this effect by upregulating the expression of CFs exosomes/microvesicles miR-423-3p, which targets the downstream effector RAP2C."

A protein module enriched in astrocyte-specific EV markers was most significantly associated with the AD pathology and cognitive impairment, suggesting an important role in AD progression. The hub protein from this module, integrin-β1 (ITGB1), was found to be significantly elevated in astrocyte-specific EVs enriched from the total brain-derived AD EVs and associated with the brain β-amyloid and tau load in independent cohorts.

The hippocampus, cortex, and blood plasma extracellular vesicles of 3- and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice were analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Subsequent bioinformatics and biochemical analyses were performed to compare the molecular signatures between wild type and 5xFAD mice across different brain regions and age groups to elucidate disease pathology. There was a unique signature of significantly altered proteins in the hippocampal and cortical proteomes of 3- and 6-month-old mice. The plasma extracellular vesicle proteomes exhibited distinct informatic features compared with the other proteomes. Furthermore, the regulation of several canonical pathways (including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling) differed between the hippocampus and cortex. Twelve potential biomarkers for the detection of early-stage Alzheimer's disease were identified and validated using plasma extracellular vesicles from stage-divided patients. Finally, integrin α-IIb, creatine kinase M-type, filamin C, glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase 2, and lysosomal α-mannosidase were selected as distinguishing biomarkers for healthy individuals and early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients using machine learning modeling with approximately 79% accuracy.

EVs released from activated or apoptotic cells contain specific proteins (signaling molecules, receptors, integrins, cytokines), bioactive lipids, nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNA, small non coding RNAs, DNA) from their progenitor cells. In the brain, EVs contribute to intercellular communication through their basal release and uptake by surrounding cells, or release into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood.

These results may encourage researchers to further investigate the molecular pathways involved in memory improvement after stem cell and exosome therapy, with the goal of increasing the efficacy and safety of exosome-based treatments for AD."

It is characterized by tau lesions that spread throughout the brain in a spatio-temporal manner. This has led to the prion-like propagation hypothesis implicating a transfer of pathological tau seeds from cell to cell. Human brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BD-EVs) isolated from the brain-derived fluid of AD patients contain seeds that contribute to this tau pathology spreading. Knowing the rich diversity of EVs, isolation of functional EV sub-populations is required to unravel their implication in the pathophysiology of AD. Here, enriched-small EVs (eSEVs) and enriched-large EVs (eLEVs) were isolated from frozen tissues after collagenase enzymatic brain dissociation to guarantee the best EVs' integrity. Then proteomic profiling and tau seeding capacity testing were performed in vitro and in vivo. BD-EVs were stratified according to their size (eSEVs and eLEVs) and characterized to define new markers specific to EVs in AD. Both AD-derived eSEVs and eLEVs show the presence of GWAS-associated proteins and indicate a specific AD pathophysiological signature. Notably, AD eSEVs contain more proteins relative to the integrin-mediated synaptic signaling, while AD eLEVs proteins were more related to respiratory electron transport and brain immunity. Injection of these vesicles in transgenic mouse brain revealed that the AD-derived eSEVs are more prone than eLEVs to participate in the prion-like propagation and hence represent an interesting therapeutic target. This study highlights the significant contribution of AD-derived EVs to tau propagation and provides new insights into different roles of EV sub-populations in AD."

MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance. Results from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Health's ""Up For A Challenge"" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of β1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells). Beta-cyclodextrins (βCD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller alpha-cyclodextrins (αCD) also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-αCD to be twice as effective as HPβCD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. If the previous successful animal studies with βCDs are replicated with the safer and more effective αCDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with αCDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPαCD, but women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively."

Additionally, transplanted cells may endogenously repair ECs by secreting angiogenic factors as our subsequent in vitro study demonstrated. Based on these study results, hBM-EPCs may secrete extracellular vesicles, which may contain and transfer diverse vesicular biomolecules towards maintenance of EC functionality. The study aimed to characterize extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from hBM-EPCs as potential cell-free therapeutics for endothelium repair in ALS. EVs were isolated from hBM-EPC media at different culture times and vesicle properties were evaluated. The protective effects of EVs on mouse brain endothelial cells (mBECs) exposed to ALS mouse plasma were investigated. Uptake and blockage of EVs from GFP-transfected hBM-EPCs in ECs were determined in vitro. Results showed that EVs isolated from hBM-EPCs as nanosized vesicles significantly reduced mBEC damage from the pathological environment and these EVs were taken up by cells. Blockage of β1 integrin on EVs prevented internalization of vesicles in mBECs. Together, these results provide evidence for potential of hBM-EPC-derived EVs as novel cell-free therapeutics for repair of endothelium in ALS. Although determining translational potential of hBM-EPC-derived EVs will require evaluation in vivo, this in vitro study represents a step towards an extracellular vesicle-based approach for repair of the damaged microvascular endothelium in ALS."

Healthy adult (aged 18-35 years) soccer players were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: the HI group performed 10 standing headers, the leg impact group performed 10 soccer ball trapping maneuvers over 10 min, and the control group did not participate in any soccer drills.

Next-generation sequencing was utilized to identify candidate miRNAs isolated from sEVs, and candidate microRNAs were analyzed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In silico target prediction was performed using TargetScan (Version 7.0; targetscan.org) and miRWalk (http://mirwalk.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/) programs, and target validation was performed using luciferase reporter vectors with a miR-7844-5p mimic in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T/17 cells.

Within HSPGs, the protein cores determine when and where HSPG expression takes place, and the HS chains mediate most of HSPG's biological roles through binding various protein ligands, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and receptors, morphogens, proteases, protease inhibitors, and ECM proteins. Through these interactions, HSPGs modulate cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis to display essential functions in physiology and pathology. Under physiological conditions, the expression and localization of HSPGs are finely regulated to orchestrate their physiological functions, and this is disrupted in cancer. The HSPG dysregulation elicits multiple oncogenic signaling, including growth factor signaling, ECM and Integrin signaling, chemokine and immune signaling, cancer stem cell, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence, to prompt cell transformation, proliferation, tumor invasion and metastasis, tumor angiogenesis and inflammation, and immunotolerance. These oncogenic roles make HSPGs an attractive pharmacological target for anti-cancer therapy.

Selective blockage of αvβ3/αvβ5 integrins with cilengitide suppressed EV- and LPS-induced lipid raft formation in microglia. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 and P2X4R prevented EV-induced phagocytic activity of human microglial cells. We demonstrate that EVs induce lipid raft formation in human microglia through interaction with TLR4, P2X4R, and αVβ3/αVβ5 signaling pathways. Our results provide new insights about the molecular mechanisms regulating EV/microglia interactions and could be used for the development of new therapeutic strategies against neurological disorders."

Although associated with aging-related neurodegeneration, the role of VGVAPG in this context has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of VGVAPG on Tau phosphorylation, synaptic proteins, choline metabolism, and the involvement of specific kinases in a human neuronal in vitro model, using selective inhibitors (Roscovitine, TDZD-8, SCH772984, SK1). All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were employed due to their well-characterized neuronal phenotype and established utility in screening studies. Our results indicate that VGVAPG-induced signaling is mediated via SRC kinase, likely leading to activation of the RAS-RAF-ERK1/2-ELK1 pathway. This cascade results in increased CDK5 protein expression and elevated CIP2A levels, which may, in turn, inhibit PP2A function. Additionally, VGVAPG downregulated the PI3K-AKT pathway through PTEN activation, thereby relieving the inhibition of GSK3β. Consequently, we observed increased phosphorylation of Tau at S396, S404, S202/T205, and T231. Impairment of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins (SYN2, SNAP-25, SYP), along with alterations in ACh levels and AChE activity, appeared to be linked to ERK1/2 signaling, Tau accumulation, and potentially CDK5-dependent mechanisms. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the possible contribution of the elastin-derived VGVAPG hexapeptide to the pathogenesis of aging-related neurodegeneration. While our model does not definitively confirm an AD-like phenotype, these results support the need for further investigation in more physiologically relevant systems."

We therefore hypothesized that drug-loaded EXO may mix well with their companion small extracellular vesicles to specifically target the aimed metastatic organ via organotropism. Here, we demonstrate that the circulating breast-cancer-derived EXO loaded with doxorubicin (EXO-DOX) can mingled with their original companion EXO and inhibit breast cancer metastasis to lungs. The CD47 on the EXO-DOX prevented EXO-DOX from immune attack and prolonged their circulation in blood. The tissue distribution ratio of EXO-DOX is identical to the ratio of their companion EXO due to the specific affinity of EXO to integrins in targeted tissues. Quantitative accumulation of EXO-DOX in the mouse lungs is proportional to the organotropism of the circulating breast cancer cells that disseminate from subcutaneously-implanted human breast cancer cells in mice. EXO-DOX inhibited angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation, resulting in prevention of breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. This study opens a novel path to use Trojan small extracellular vesicles for specifically controlled release of active components by small extracellular vesicles organotropism mechanism to the targeted organ for disease chemoprevention."

In recent years, the morbidity of PCa is steadily rising annually in China. Prostate cancer is prone to distant metastasis, and the most significant complication among patients with advanced PCa is bone metastases. Most patients with prostate cancer do not die of the primary tumour, but more due to the factors of distant metastasis of organs, especially bone metastasis. Due to the lack of effective prevention and monitoring of bone metastasis of PCa in clinical settings, and the lack of effective treatment for patients with bone metastasis, the prognosis of patients is often poor. Therefore, early prevention, early detection, and inhibition of bone metastasis are particularly important. At present, many studies have found that exosomes and integrins are closely related to bone metastasis of prostate cancer, but they have not been summarized together. This review summarizes the literature on the effects of exosomes and integrins on bone metastasis of prostate cancer in recent years. It aims to find more effective ways to prevent, monitor, and treat prostate cancer from the relationship between them."

The activities of integrins are alternatively controlled by homotypic lateral association with themselves to induce integrin clustering and/or by heterotypic lateral engagement with tetraspanin and syndecan in the same cells to modulate integrin adhesiveness. It has recently emerged that integrins are expressed not only in cells but also in exosomes, important entities of extracellular vesicles secreted from cells. Exosomal integrins have received considerable attention in recent years, and they are clearly involved in determining the tissue distribution of exosomes, forming premetastatic niches, supporting internalization of exosomes by target cells and mediating exosome-mediated transfer of the membrane proteins and associated kinases to target cells. A growing body of evidence shows that tumor and immune cell exosomes have the ability to alter endothelial characteristics (proliferation, migration) and gene expression, some of these effects being facilitated by vesicle-bound integrins. As endothelial metabolism is now thought to play a key role in tumor angiogenesis, we also discuss how tumor cells and their exosomes pleiotropically modulate endothelial functions in the tumor microenvironment."

First, exosomes modulate the primary tumor sites to assist cancer growth and dissemination. In this part, five main biological events are reviewed, including the transfer of oncogenic constituents, the recruitment and activation of fibroblasts, the induction of angiogenesis, immunosuppression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotion. In Step 2, we list two recently disclosed mechanisms during the organ-specific homing process: the exosomal integrin model and exosomal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/miR-26/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) model. Subsequently, Step 3 focuses on the interactions between exosomes and pre-metastatic niche, in which we highlight the specific functions of exosomes in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, immune modulation and metabolic, epigenetic and stromal reprogramming of pre-metastatic niche.

This transfer has been shown to influence the metastatic behavior of primary tumors. Moreover, tumor-derived EVs have been shown to influence distant cellular niches, establishing favorable microenvironments that support growth of disseminated cancer cells upon their arrival at these pre-metastatic niches.

However, increasing evidence suggests that even within these EV populations various subpopulations may exist. This heterogeneity introduces an extra level of complexity in the study of EV biology and function. For example, EV subpopulations could have unique roles in the intricate biological processes underlying cancer biology. Here, we discuss current knowledge regarding the role of subpopulations of EVs in cancer development and progression and highlight the relevance of EV heterogeneity.

In rat and mouse models of ischemic HF, we show that miR-30d gain of function (genetic, lentivirus, or agomiR-mediated) improves cardiac function, decreases myocardial fibrosis, and attenuates cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. Genetic or locked nucleic acid-based knock-down of miR-30d expression potentiates pathological left ventricular remodeling, with increased dysfunction, fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte death. RNA sequencing of in vitro miR-30d gain and loss of function, together with bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, were used to identify and validate direct targets of miR-30d. miR-30d expression is selectively enriched in cardiomyocytes, induced by hypoxic stress and is acutely protective, targeting MAP4K4 (mitogen-associate protein kinase 4) to ameliorate apoptosis. Moreover, miR-30d is secreted primarily in extracellular vesicles by cardiomyocytes and inhibits fibroblast proliferation and activation by directly targeting integrin α5 in the acute phase via paracrine signaling to cardiac fibroblasts. In the chronic phase of ischemic remodeling, lower expression of miR-30d in the heart and plasma extracellular vesicles is associated with adverse remodeling in rodent models and human subjects and is linked to whole-blood expression of genes implicated in fibrosis and inflammation, consistent with observations in model systems. These findings provide the mechanistic underpinning for the cardioprotective association of miR-30d in human HF.

Utilizing high-resolution two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) alongside bioinformatic analysis, we identified significant alterations in protein expression profiles, particularly in angiogenesis and wound healing pathways. The functional impact of these changes was validated through biological assays, where the whole secretome and the EV fraction from EPCs seeded on collagen-bound LDS markedly enhanced vascular network formation, driven by the increase of growth factors and angiogenic regulators such as FGFR1, NRP1, and ANGPT2 within the EV fraction. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further highlighted the enrichment of proteins within the EVs driving biological processes, including 'response to wounding' and 'positive regulation of cell motility'. These results underscore that LDS modulates the EPC secretome and significantly enhances its angiogenic potential, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for non-healing and ischemic wounds and suggesting that biomaterials can be modified to control the EV secretome to enhance tissue repair.

Csk knockdown increased Src phosphorylation (Tyr416) and VE-cadherin phosphorylation (Tyr685 and Tyr731), while abolishing Adipsin-induced inhibition of VE-cadherin internalization. Furthermore, Csk knockdown counteracted Adipsin-induced protective effects on endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro and endothelial barrier integrity of coronary microvessels in vivo. Together, these findings favor the vital role of Adipsin in the regulation of CMECs adherens junctions integrity, revealing its promises as a treatment target against diabetic coronary microvascular dysfunction.

To determine the effects of antiretrovirals in common clinical use upon in vitro endothelial function to better understand cardiovascular risk in people living with HIV. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells or human coronary artery endothelial cells were pretreated with the antiretrovirals abacavir sulphate (ABC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or tenofovir alafenamide. Expression of adhesion molecules, ectonucleotidases (CD39 and CD73), tissue factor (TF), endothelial-derived microparticle (EMP) numbers and phenotype, and platelet activation were evaluated by flow cytometry. TF and ectonucleotidase activities were measured using colourimetric plate-based assays. ABC-treated endothelial cells had higher levels of ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule)-1 and TF expression following TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α stimulation. In contrast, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and tenofovir alafenamide treatment gave rise to greater populations of CD39 We report differential effects of antiretrovirals used in the treatment of HIV upon endothelial function.

We isolated the participants' plasma EVs and analyzed their levels of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. We noted no significant changes in the plasma EV-derived cytokine profiles of the PwPs and HCs between baseline and the 1-year follow-up. Among the PwP, changes in plasma EV-derived IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were significantly associated with changes in the severity of postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD) and cognition. Baseline plasma EV-derived IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were significantly associated with the severity of PIGD and cognitive symptoms at follow-up, and PwP with elevated IL-1β and IL-6 levels exhibited significant progression of PIGD over the study period. These results suggested the role of inflammation in PD progression. In addition, baseline levels of plasma EV-derived proinflammatory cytokines can be used to predict the progression of PIGD, the most severe motor symptom of PD. Additional studies with longer follow-up periods are necessary, and plasma EV-derived cytokines may serve as effective biomarkers of PD progression."

An animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ (3 mg/kg) in male Wistar rats (250 ± 50 g). ICV STZ injections chronically reduce cerebral glucose uptake and produce other effects similar to pathological, molecular and behavioral features of AD. Numerous studies confirmed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of curcumin (a natural polyphenol) against free radicals, as well as its ability to inhibit the aggregation of proteins such as beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein in disorders such as AD and Parkinson's disease. The use of extracellular vesicles has garnered a lot of interest in research studies because of the important roles that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes play in permeability, retention, and drug delivery as well as their ability to reduce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). Furthermore, researches highlighted the positive effect of curcumin on neuronal differentiation of stem cells in vivo and in vitro. Since studies emphasized the ameliorating effect of curcumin-treated macrophage-exosomes on symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting tau protein phosphorylation, we proposed that Curcumin-primed MSC exosomes may offer greater efficacy to alleviate AD compared to naïve MSC exosomes. In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin in stimulating the anti-inflammatory potential of exosome-derived stem cells. We evaluated the effect of MSC-EXO and pre-treated MSC-EXO with curcumin (CUR-MSC-EXO) on inhibiting inflammation and memory and learning impairments. Following four intraperitoneal injections of MSC-EXO and CUR-MSC-EXO at a dosage of 30μg/body over 30 days, we found that MSC-EXO and CUR-MSC-EXO elevated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL10, TGF-β) and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, TNF-α) in peripheral blood compared to the AD group. The elevated level of M2 anti-inflammatory microglia markers (Arg1, CD206) and decreased level expression of M1 pro-inflammatory markers (iNOS, CD86) indicated that the CUR-MSC-EXO effect was more significant in the polarization of microglia into the M2 phenotype in the rat hippocampus. Both treatment groups demonstrated improvements in memory and learning skills. The results of the passive avoidance learning in the rats with STZ-induced memory impairment, however, were better in the CUR-MSC-EXO. Additionally, after therapy, a decrease in degenerative neurons was seen. Therefore, using curcumin may stimulate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential of exosome-derived stem cells which could provide hope for Alzheimer's disease treatment in the future."

Its dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of complex modern diseases, spanning neurodegeneration, metabolic syndromes, and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review examines the pathway's role as an integrative hub and its potential as a therapeutic target. We synthesize current mechanistic evidence from molecular, cellular, and preclinical studies to elucidate the pathway's operational logic and the consequences of its dysregulation. The analysis is structured around key disease paradigms-including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cardiovascular injury, stroke, and chronic kidney disease-to dissect its tissue-specific pathophysiological impacts. The AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α axis operates through a core positive feedback loop: AMPK activation elevates NAD+, thereby activating SIRT1, which in turn deacetylates and activates PGC-1α to drive mitochondrial biogenesis and function, further reinforcing SIRT1 activity. Disruption of this cascade manifests in disease-specific mechanisms: promoting Aβ production via BACE1/γ-secretase in Alzheimer's; impairing α-synuclein clearance in Parkinson's; disrupting GLUT4 translocation and insulin signaling in diabetes; exacerbating oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiovascular and neuronal injury; and accelerating fibrosis and sustained inflammation in renal and pulmonary diseases via NLRP3 and TGF-β/Smad3 signaling. The AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway represents a cornerstone target at the intersection of metabolism, aging, and disease. Current therapeutic strategies-including pharmacological activators (e.g., metformin, SRT1720), natural compounds (e.g., resveratrol), lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise, caloric restriction), and emerging technologies (e.g., gene editing, exosomal miRNAs)-offer multidimensional avenues for intervention. Future research must prioritize elucidating tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms, such as AMPK isoform diversity and PGC-1α interactome dynamics, to enable precision therapeutics and successful clinical translation for a range of complex disorders."

We adopted western blot for observing macrophage polarization and the impact of JAK-STAT inhibitor on caspase-9, eNOS, NF-κB p65 expression, extracted exosomes, and total exosome RNA of each group of cells. Their miRNA expression profiles were also analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. (1) In comparison with the control group, relative iNOS protein expression in ERK inhibitor group dramatically declined (p < 0.05), and the iNOS protein content in the NF-κB inhibitor group and the JAK-STAT inhibitor group conspicuously dwindled (p < 0.05); relative CD206 protein expression in each inhibitor group was clearly augmented (p > 0.05). Under the intervention of high glucose, ERK/JAK-STAT/NF-κB inhibitors brilliantly diminished the up-regulation of caspase-9 (p < 0.05), and ERK/JAK-STAT inhibitors notably minimized the up-regulation of NF-κB p65 (p < 0.05). ELISA results unveiled that in contrast to the control group, TNF-α, IL-1β, and CXCL10 levels in the macrophage supernatant of the inhibitor group was tellingly augmented (p < 0.05), whereas TGF-β level had strikingly declined (p < 0.05), proving that macrophages were activated to M1.

MSC-exosomes were isolated from human umbilical cords through ultracentrifugation and characterized. An experimental fibrosis model was established in BALB/c mice by a subcutaneous injection of bleomycin, followed by treatment with MSC-exosomes or MSC infusions once a week for a total of four doses. Using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry, hydroxyproline content, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses, we investigated the effects of MSC-exosomes on dermal fibrosis and explored the underlying mechanism. MSC-exosome treatment restored the dermal architecture, reduced dermal thickness, and partially increased subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. In addition, MSC-exosomes inhibited the expression of collagen (COL)-I, COL-III, and α-smooth muscle actin. The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad signaling pathway was also suppressed in MSC-exosome-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest that MSC-exosomes can attenuate myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition in dermal fibrosis by downregulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, the use of MSC-exosomes may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of scleroderma."

PRP-derived EVs from treadmill-loaded and sedentary rats were designated athletes (aPRP-EVs) and non-athlete (nPRP-EVs), respectively. Both were administered to primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and to adult male Wistar/ST rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Exercise increased CD63, CD31, and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in PRP-derived EVs. In OGD-exposed neurons, aPRP-EVs enhanced viability, elevated phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, and reduced intracellular calcium. Canonical pathway analysis showed upregulated TGF-β/SMAD signaling in EV groups versus vehicle, while 'Ca signaling' was downregulated in aPRP-EVs versus nPRP-EVs. In MCAO rats, EVs improved neurological and motor function and reduced neuronal apoptosis at 28 days, with aPRP-EVs promoting earlier, greater recovery and infarct reduction. These effects correlated with TGF-β1 upregulation, SMAD4 nuclear translocation, reduced NMDAR2B expression, and enhanced axonal growth in the peri-infarct region.

After modulation with miR-124 mimic/inhibitor, we identified common responsive mechanisms between such models. We also reported miR-124 colocalization with microglia in AD patient hippocampi. Herein, we determined how miR-124 modulation in SWE cells influences microglia polarized subtypes in the context of inflammation. We used a coculture system without cell-to-cell contact formed by miR-124 modulated SWE cells and human CHME3 microglia stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFNγ-MG), in which we assessed their adopted gene/miRNA profile and proteomic signature. The increase of miR-124 in SWE cells/secretome (soluble and exosomal) was mimicked in IFNγ-MG. Treatment of SWE cells with the miR-124 inhibitor led to RAGE overexpression and loss of neuronal viability, while the mimic caused RAGE/HMGB1 downregulation and prevented mitochondria membrane potential loss. When accessing the paracrine effects on microglia, SWE miR-124 inhibitor favored their IFNγ-induced inflammatory signature (upregulated RAGE/HMGB1/iNOS/IL-1β; downregulated IL-10/ARG-1), while the mimic reduced microglia activation (downregulated TNF-α/iNOS) and deactivated extracellular MMP-2/MMP-9 levels. Microglia proteomics identified 113 responsive proteins to SWE miR-124 levels, including a subgroup of 17 proteins involved in immune function/inflammation and/or miR-124 targets. A total of 72 proteins were downregulated (e.g., MAP2K6) and 21 upregulated (e.g., PAWR) by the mimic, while the inhibitor also upregulated 21 proteins and downregulated 17 (e.g., TGFB1, PAWR, and EFEMP1). Other targets were associated with neurodevelopmental mechanisms, synaptic function, and vesicular trafficking. To examine the source of miR-124 variations in microglia, we silenced the RNase III endonuclease Dicer1 to block miRNA canonical biogenesis. Despite this suppression, the coculture with SWE cells/exosomes still raised microglial miR-124 levels, evidencing miR-124 transfer from neurons to microglia. This study is pioneer in elucidating that neuronal miR-124 reshapes microglia plasticity and in revealing the relevance of neuronal survival in mechanisms underlying inflammation in AD-associated neurodegeneration. These novel insights pave the way for the application of miRNA-based neuropharmacological strategies in AD whenever miRNA dysregulated levels are identified during patient stratification."

We found that the lncRNA content was similar between samples, with PCBP1-AS1, TEX41, and PVT1 being the top represented transcripts. There were 286 miRNAs found in the salEV samples. The pathways predicted to be affected by the top represented miRNAs include Hippo signaling, TGF-β signaling, Wnt signaling, FoxO signaling, ErbB signaling, axon guidance, and mTOR signaling. We could detect retrotransposon transcripts from LINE, SINE, and LTR elements in salEVs. When compared to blood-derived EVs, salEVs showed greater representation of transcripts associated with neurodegenerative pathways. Our results indicate that salEVs contain transcripts that are associated with pathways involved in neurodegeneration. The presence of these transcripts in salEVs suggest that saliva may be used to screen for biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases."

By mapping functional readouts onto the underlying biological events of each phase, we highlight how tools such as the Sciatic Functional Index, Beam Walk test, Rotarod test, nerve conduction studies, and nociceptive assays provide complementary and often non-interchangeable information about motor, sensory, and neuromuscular recovery. We further examine emerging therapeutic strategies, including intraoperative electrical stimulation, immunomodulation, platelet-rich plasma, bioengineered scaffolds, conductive and piezoelectric conduits, exosome-based hydrogels, tacrolimus delivery systems, and small molecules, emphasizing the importance of aligning their mechanisms of action with the dynamic microenvironment of peripheral nerve repair. Despite substantial advancements in experimental models, an analysis of publication trends and registries reveals a persistent translational gap, with remarkably few clinical trials relative to the high volume of preclinical studies. To illustrate how mechanistic insights can be complemented by molecular-level characterization, we also present a targeted computational analysis of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA,) including frontier orbital energies, physicochemical descriptors, and docking interactions with IL-6, TGF-β, and a growth-factor receptor-performed solely for this molecule due to its documented structural availability and relevance. By presenting an integrated, phase-specific framework for functional assessment and therapeutic evaluation, this review underscores the need for standardized, biologically aligned methodologies to improve the rigor, comparability, and clinical relevance of future studies in sciatic nerve regeneration."

The human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hUC-MSC) secretome has emerged as a promising cell-free therapeutic alternative owing to its potent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties. Comprising of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular vesicles enriched with bioactive miRNAs, the hUC-MSC secretome exerts its effects primarily through paracrine signaling. For this review, relevant literature was collected from established databases, including ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using key terms such as ""hUC-MSC secretome,"" ""chronic inflammation,"" ""exosomes,"" ""tumor microenvironment,"" and ""preconditioning."" The search focused on studies published within the last five years, emphasizing in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, original research, and review articles. Only studies specifically exploring hUC-MSC-derived secretomes were included, whereas those addressing cell-based therapies or secretomes from other MSC sources were excluded. Cumulative findings indicate that the hUC-MSC secretome alleviates chronic inflammation by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as regulatory miRNAs such as miR-29a-3p, miR-100-5p, and miR-125b-5p, which act via key signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT. These mechanisms collectively mediate anti-inflammatory responses, suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhance chemosensitivity, and promote tissue repair. This review aims to consolidate the emerging evidence that positions the hUC-MSC secretome as a next-generation cell-free therapeutic strategy for chronic inflammatory diseases, including major cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative disorders, while highlighting current limitations and strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and clinical applicability of the hUC-MSC secretome."

Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that natural melanoma exosomes might directly influence macrophage polarization. To explore this hypothesis, ELISA, RT-qPCR, and macrophage functional studies were performed in vitro using an established source of melanoma exosomes (B16-F10). ELISA results for melanoma exosome induction of common M1 and M2 cytokines in RAW 264.7 macrophages, revealed that melanoma exosomes do not polarize macrophages exclusively in the M1 or M2 direction. Melanoma exosomes induced the M1 and M2 representative cytokines TNF-α and IL-10 respectively. Further assessment, using an RT-qPCR array with RAW 264.7 and primary macrophages, confirmed and extended the ELISA findings. Upregulation of markers common to both M1 and M2 polarization phenotypes included CCL22, IL-12B, IL-1β, IL-6, i-NOS, and TNF-α. The M2 cytokine TGF-β was upregulated in primary but not RAW 264.7 macrophages. Pro-tumor functions have been attributed to each of these markers. Macrophage functional assays demonstrated a trend toward increased i-NOS (M1) to arginase (M2) activity. Collectively, the results provide the first evidence that melanoma exosomes can induce a mixed M1 and M2 pro-tumor macrophage activation phenotype."

CRC cells-derived exosomes were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blot. CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays, and flow cytometry assays were conducted to assess whether exosomes would affect the proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis of CRC cells, respectively. Moreover, we performed the RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR to identify circRNAs in exosome-stimulated CRC cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was used to detect the cellular distribution of circPACRGL. Bioinformatic analyses (StarBase 2.0) were used to pool the miRNA targets of circPACRGL. Luciferase assays were performed to verify the direct interaction. Finally, flow cytometry was used to detect the differentiation of N1-N2 neutrophils. Our study identified a novel CRC-derived exosomal circRNA, circPACRGL. We found circPACRGL was significantly upregulated in CRC cells after tumor-derived exosomes addition.

Pharmacological inhibition of USP8 antagonizes TGF-β/SMAD signaling, and reduces TβRII stability and the number of TβRII+ crEVs to prevent CD8+ T cell exhaustion and to reactivate anti-tumor immunity. Our findings not only reveal a novel mechanism whereby USP8 regulates the cancer microenvironment but also demonstrate the therapeutic advantages of engineering USP8 inhibitors to simultaneously suppress metastasis and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy."

Many studies have demonstrated that EMT is a prominent event that is associated with embryogenesis, tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The EMT process is driven by key transcription factors (such as Snail, Twist, ZEB, and TGF-β) and several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in many non-pathological as well as pathological conditions. In the present report, we have comprehensively discussed the oncogenic and tumor suppressor role of lncRNAs and their mechanism of action in the regulation of the EMT process in various cancers such as brain tumors, gastrointestinal tumors, and gynecological and urological tumors. We have also elaborated on the role of lncRNAs in the regulation of EMT-related transcription factors (such as Snail, Twist, ZEB, and TGF-β) and therapeutic response (chemoresistance and radioresistance). Lastly, we have emphasized the role of exosomal lncRNAs in the regulation of EMT, metastasis, and therapeutic response in the aforementioned cancers. Taken together, this review provides a detailed insight into the understanding of role of lncRNAs/exosomal lncRNAs in EMT, metastasis, and therapeutic response in human cancers."

The in-silico gene expression analysis showed, TGF-β1 and TGFβR2 are upregulated in cells infected with human papilloma virus (HPV)16, whereas, TGF-β2, TGFβR1 and TGFβR3 expression were downregulated. In HPV 18 infected cells, TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and TGFβR1 were downregulated, meanwhile, TGF-β3, TGFβR2 and TGFβR3 were upregulated. OS analysis of CC patients with different TGF-β expression revealed that, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3 and TGFβR2 were associated with reduced survival rate.

With no obvious genetic mutation(s) driving tumor progression or metastatic transition, the challenges for understanding the biological mechanism(s) of these processes are paramount. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these processes could lead to new diagnostic tools for patient management and new targets for therapeutic intervention. microRNAs (miRNAs) are an evolutionarily conserved gene class of short non-coding regulatory RNAs. miRNAs are an extensive regulatory layer that controls gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. This review focuses on preclinical models that functionally dissect miRNA activity in tumor progression or metastatic processes in PDAC. Collectively, these studies suggest an influence of miRNAs and RNA-RNA networks in the processes of epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition and cancer cell stemness. At a cell-type level, some miRNAs mainly influence cancer cell-intrinsic processes and pathways, whereas other miRNAs predominantly act in distinct cellular compartments of the TME to regulate fibroblast and immune cell functions and/or influence other cell types' function via cell-to-cell communications by transfer of extracellular vesicles. At a molecular level, the influence of miRNA-mediated regulation often converges in core signaling pathways, including TGF-β, JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB."

This review synthesizes current evidence on how exosomes modulate tumor metabolism and drive drug resistance, and outlines therapeutic opportunities. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for English-language studies using terms related to exosomes/extracellular vesicles, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), lipid metabolism, and drug resistance/chemoresistance, and integrated the literature qualitatively. Evidence indicates that exosomes reprogram tumor and stromal metabolism by delivering enzymes and non-coding RNAs that boost glycolysis and dampen OXPHOS, activate cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and modulate ferroptosis. They stimulate angiogenesis (e.g., via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/Wnt pathways) and promote immune escape through programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and macrophage reprogramming. Exosomal integrins and proteases contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), organotropism, and pre-metastatic niche formation. Critically, exosomes propagate chemoresistance by exporting drugs and spreading determinants-including P-gp/BCRP/MRP-1, anti-apoptotic proteins, and regulatory RNAs-to previously sensitive cells; adipose-derived vesicles and lipid cargos further reinforce metabolic plasticity and therapy resistance. Given their stability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, exosomes are promising vectors for targeted delivery; engineered vesicles can enhance chemotherapy responsiveness and counteract resistance, particularly alongside immunotherapy. In summary, interventions that disrupt exosome biogenesis, cargo loading, or uptake-paired with engineered exosomes for precision delivery-could mitigate drug resistance, metastasis, and immune evasion and advance more effective cancer treatment."

The tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interaction with tumor cells play a crucial role in CRLM progression. Notably, the stability and peak levels of tumor-derived exosomal miRNAs facilitate intercellular communication in the TME. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), key liver mesenchymal cells, constitute about 33% of the liver's nonsolid cell population and exhibit plasticity. However, the specific role of tumor-derived exosomal miRNAs in the crosstalk between HSCs and tumor cells during the CRLM process remains unclear. We studied CRC-secreted exosomal miR-1246 and its impact on HSCs, as well as its effects on CRC cell proliferation and metastasis. Our findings demonstrate that CRC-secreted exosomal miR-1246 can be internalized by HSCs, leading to their activation and facilitating the metastatic potential of CRC cells. Mechanistically, exosomal miR-1246 targets INSIG1, resulting in SREBP2 nucleation and cholesterol metabolism alterations. This accumulation of free cholesterol (FC) regulates the TLR4/NF-κB/TGF-β pathway, promoting HSC activation. Activated HSCs, in turn, enhance liver metastasis of CRC cells through the TNFSF13/TNFRSF13B axis. Our study reveals the role of CRC-secreted exosomal miR-1246 in triggering HSC activation and reprogramming the TME, ultimately facilitating liver metastasis in CRC patients.

Cell phenotype was assessed by EdU and flow cytometry. MiR-106a and its targets were authenticated by luciferase reporter assay. The mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration were determined and morphological transformation was measured by transwell assay. Immunodeficient mouse was conducted to investigate the tumorigenesis and tumor growth. The final was tissue analysis. MiR-106a enrichment in GC-exosomes can be delivered and integrated into PMC to establish a proper pre-metastatic niche (PMN).

The aggressive behavior of CSCs is guided by several intracellular signaling pathways such as WNT, NF-kappa-B, NOTCH, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT, PI3K/AKT1/MTOR, TGF/SMAD, PPAR and MAPK kinases, as well as extracellular vesicles such as exosomes, and extracellular signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, pro-angiogenetic and growth factors, which finely regulate CSC phenotype. In this scenario, tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key player in the establishment of a permissive tumor niche, where CSCs engage in intricate communications with diverse immune cells. The ""oncogenic"" immune cells are mainly represented by B and T lymphocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Among immune cells, macrophages exhibit a more plastic and adaptable phenotype due to their different subpopulations, which are characterized by both immunosuppressive and inflammatory phenotypes. Specifically, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) create an immunosuppressive milieu through the production of a plethora of paracrine factors (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, CCL1, CCL18) promoting the acquisition by CSCs of a stem-like, invasive and metastatic phenotype. TAMs have demonstrated the ability to communicate with CSCs via direct ligand/receptor (such as CD90/CD11b, LSECtin/BTN3A3, EPHA4/Ephrin) interaction. On the other hand, CSCs exhibited their capacity to influence immune cells, creating a favorable microenvironment for cancer progression. Interestingly, the bidirectional influence of CSCs and TME leads to an epigenetic reprogramming which sustains malignant transformation. Nowadays, the integration of biological and computational data obtained by cutting-edge technologies (single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, trajectory analysis) has significantly improved the comprehension of the biunivocal multicellular dialogue, providing a comprehensive view of the heterogeneity and dynamics of CSCs, and uncovering alternative mechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, the combination of biology and computational data will lead to the development of innovative target therapies dampening CSC-TME interaction. Here, we aim to elucidate the most recent insights on CSCs biology and their complex interactions with TME immune cells, specifically TAMs, tracing an exhaustive scenario from the primary tumor to metastasis formation."

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling drives metastasis and is strongly enhanced during cancer progression. Yet, the use of on-target TGF-β signaling inhibitors in the treatment of cancer patients remains unsuccessful, highlighting a gap in the understanding of TGF-β biology that limits the establishment of efficient anti-metastatic therapies. Here, we show that TGF-β signaling hyperactivation in breast cancer cells is required for metastasis and relies on increased small extracellular vesicle (sEV) secretion. Demonstrating sEV's unique role, TGF-β signaling levels induced by sEVs exceed the activity of matching concentrations of soluble ligand TGF-β. Further, genetic disruption of sEV secretion in highly-metastatic breast cancer cells impairs cancer cell aggressiveness by reducing TGF-β signaling to nearly-normal levels. Otherwise, TGF-β signaling activity in non-invasive breast cancer cells is inherently low, but can be amplified by sEVs, enabling invasion and metastasis of poorly-metastatic breast cancer cells. Underscoring the translational potential of inhibiting sEV trafficking in advanced breast cancers, treatment with dimethyl amiloride (DMA) decreases sEV secretion, TGF-β signaling activity, and breast cancer progression in vivo. Targeting both the sEV trafficking and TGF-β signaling by combining DMA and SB431542 at suboptimal doses potentiated this effect, normalizing the TGF-β signaling in primary tumors to potently reduce circulating tumor cells, metastasis, and tumor self-seeding. Collectively, this study establishes sEVs as critical elements in TGF-β biology, demonstrating the feasibility of inhibiting sEV trafficking as a new therapeutic approach to impair metastasis by normalizing TGF-β signaling levels in breast cancer cells."

Omental fibroblasts can be activated by tumour cells to differentiate into myofibroblasts, termed the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT), which, in turn, enhances cancer aggressiveness. Here, we report crosstalk between cancer cells and omental fibroblasts through exosomal piR-25783, which fuels tumour metastasis.

EVs are secreted vesicles delimited by a lipid bilayer and play critical functions in intercellular communication, including regulation of the tumor microenvironment and cancer development. Thus, this review aims at summarizing the impact of EVs on TGF-β signaling by focusing on mechanisms by which EV cargo can influence tumorigenesis, metastatic spread, immune evasion and response to anti-cancer treatment. Moreover, we emphasize the potential of TGF-β-related molecules present in circulating EVs as useful biomarkers of prognosis, diagnosis, and prediction of response to treatment in cancer patients."

Sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) is a tumor-enhancer in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Here, we probed the influence of SUR1-expressing cancer cells on CAFs. Results showed that high SUR1 expression positively correlated with α-SMA positive staining of CAFs in tumor tissues and poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. SUR1 contributed to normal fibroblast (NF) transformation into CAFs and facilitated the growth and metastasis of NSCLC in vivo. Conditioned medium (CM) and exosomes from SUR1-expressing cancer cells induced CAFs and promoted fibroblast migration. In cancer cells, SUR1 promoted p70S6K-induced KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) phosphorylation at S395 to inhibit the binding of KHSRP with let-7a precursor (pre-let-7a) and decreasing mature let-7a-5p expression in cancer cells and exosomes. Let-7a-5p delivered by exosomes blocked NF transformation into CAFs by targeting TGFBR1 to inactivate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Glibenclamide, which targets SUR1, restrained CAFs and suppressed tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft models. Furthermore, we found that let-7a-5p was decreased in the tissues and plasma exosomes of NSCLC patients. In summary, SUR1-expressing cancer cells induce NF transformation into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment and promote NSCLC progression by transferring less exosomal let-7a-5p. Glibenclamide is a promising anti-cancer drug, and plasma exosomal let-7a-5p level is a potential diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC patients. These findings provide new therapeutic strategies by targeting SUR1 in NSCLC."

Evidence of pathological characteristics in MI illustrates cell signaling pathways that participate in the survival, proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, and stem cells. These signaling pathways include the key players in inflammation response, e.g., NLRP3/caspase-1 and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB; the crucial mediators in oxidative stress and apoptosis, for instance, Notch, Hippo/YAP, RhoA/ROCK, Nrf2/HO-1, and Sonic hedgehog; the controller of myocardial fibrosis such as TGF-β/SMADs and Wnt/β-catenin; and the main regulator of angiogenesis, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, JAK/STAT, Sonic hedgehog, etc. Since signaling pathways play an important role in administering the process of MI, aiming at targeting these aberrant signaling pathways and improving the pathological manifestations in MI is indispensable and promising. Hence, drug therapy, gene therapy, protein therapy, cell therapy, and exosome therapy have been emerging and are known as novel therapies. In this review, we summarize the therapeutic strategies for MI by regulating these associated pathways, which contribute to inhibiting cardiomyocytes death, attenuating inflammation, enhancing angiogenesis, etc. so as to repair and re-functionalize damaged hearts."

However, whether IPC-exo regulate replacement fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRs) are important cargos of exosomes and play an essential role in cardioprotection. We aim to investigate whether IPC-exo regulate post-MI replacement fibrosis by transferring cardioprotective miRs and its action mechanism. Exosomes obtained from serum of adult rats in control (Con-exo) and IPC groups were identified and analyzed, subsequently intracardially injected into MI rats following ligation. Their miRs profiles were identified using high-throughput miR sequencing to identify target miRs for bioinformatics analysis. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed target genes of selected miRs. IPC-exo transfected with selected miRs antagomir or NC were intracardially administered to MI rats post-ligation. Cardiac function and degree of replacement fibrosis were detected 4 weeks post-MI. IPC-exo exerted cardioprotective effects against excessive replacement fibrosis. MiR sequencing and RT-qPCR identified miR-133a-3p as most significantly different between IPC-exo and Con-exo. MiR-133a-3p directly targeted latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1) and protein phosphatase 2, catalytic subunit, alpha isozyme (PPP2CA). KEGG analysis showed that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was one of the most enriched signaling pathways with miR-133a-3p. Comparing to injection of IPC-exo transfected with miR-133a-3p antagomir NC, injecting IPC-exo transfected with miR-133a-3p antagomir abolished protective effects of IPC-exo on declining excessive replacement fibrosis and cardiac function enhancement, while increasing the messenger RNA and protein expression of LTBP1, PPP2CA, and TGF-β1in MI rats. IPC-exo inhibit excessive replacement fibrosis and improve cardiac function post-MI by transferring miR-133a-3p, the mechanism is associated with directly targeting LTBP1 and PPP2CA, and indirectly regulating TGF-β pathway in rats.

Many studies have suggested that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to hepatic tissue repair and functional recovery through paracrine mechanisms mediated by exosomes. Minipigs exhibit much more similar characteristics of the liver to those of humans than rodents. This study aimed to explore whether exosomes from adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs-exo) could actively promote liver regeneration after hepatectomy combined with HIRI in minipigs and the role they play in the cell proliferation process. This study also compared the effects and differences in the role of ADSCs and ADSCs-exo in the inflammatory response and liver regeneration. The results showed that ADSCs-exo suppressed histopathological changes and reduced inflammatory infiltration in the liver; significantly decreased levels of ALT, TBIL, HA, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP; increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-regeneration factors Ki67, PCNA, CyclinD1, HGF, STAT3, VEGF, ANG1, ANG2; and decreased levels of the anti-regeneration factors SOCS3 and TGF-β. These indicators above showed similar changes with the ADSCs intervention group. Indicating that ADSCs-exo can exert the same role as ADSCs in regulating inflammatory responses and promoting liver regeneration. Our findings provide experimental evidence for the possibility that ADSCs-exo could be considered a safe and effective cell-free therapy to promote regeneration of injured livers."

Our results revealed that hypoxia facilitated the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in H9c2 cell-derived exosomes. Moreover, exosomes derived from cardiomyocytes cultured under normal conditions (Nor-Exo) and Hypo-Exo could induce RAW264.7 cells into classically activated macrophages (M1) and M2 macrophages respectively. Likewise, macrophage activation was induced by circulating exosomes isolated from normal human controls (hNor-Exo) or patients with acute myocardial infarction (hAMI-Exo). Thus, our findings support that the profiles of hAMI-Exo have been changed, which could regulate the polarization of macrophages and subsequently the polarized M2 macrophages reduced the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in return. Based on our findings, we speculate that exosomes have emerged as important inflammatory response modulators regulating cardiac oxidative stress injury."

EV bioactive cargo includes graft antigens, costimulatory/inhibitory molecules, cytokines, growth factors, and functional microRNAs (miRNAs) that may modulate expression of recipient cell genes. As paracrine factors, neutrophil- and macrophage-derived EVs exert immunosuppressive and immune-stimulating effects on dendritic cells, respectively. Dendritic cell-derived EVs mediate alloantigen spreading and modulate antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. At systemic level, EVs exert pleiotropic effects on complement and coagulation. Depending on their biogenesis, they can amplify complement activation or shed complement inhibitors and prevent cell lysis. Likewise, endothelial- and platelet-derived EVs can exert procoagulant/prothrombotic effects and also promote endothelial survival and angiogenesis after ischemic injury. Kidney endothelial- and tubular-derived EVs play a key role in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and during the healing process; additionally, they can trigger rejection by inducing both alloimmune and autoimmune responses. Endothelial EVs have procoagulant/pro-inflammatory effects and can release sequestered self-antigens, generating a tissue-specific autoimmunity. Renal tubule-derived EVs shuttle pro-fibrotic mediators (TGF-β and miR-21) to interstitial fibroblasts and modulate neutrophil and T-lymphocyte influx. These processes can lead to peritubular capillary rarefaction and interstitial fibrosis-tubular atrophy. Different EVs, including those from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have been employed as a therapeutic tool in experimental models of rejection and IRI. These particles protect tubular and endothelial cells (by inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation-fibrogenesis or by inducing autophagy) and stimulate tissue regeneration (by triggering angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration). Finally, urinary and serum EVs represent potential biomarkers for delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection. In conclusion, EVs sustain an intricate crosstalk between graft tissue and innate/adaptive immune systems. EVs play a major role in allorecognition, IRI, autoimmunity, and alloimmunity and are promising as biomarkers and therapeutic tools in KT."

An Isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury model was established in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, H9C2 cardiomyoblasts were first injured with ISO and then treated with either exosomes (Exo) or RA-primed exosomes (RA-MSC-Exo) to assess cell viability and apoptosis. In vivo, 48 Wistar rats were divided into six groups: Control, Exo, RA-MSC-Exo, ISO, ISO + Exo, and ISO + RA-MSC-Exo. We assessed cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB and troponin I), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). We performed echocardiographic, molecular (real-time PCR and Western blotting), and histological analyses (Masson's trichrome staining) to evaluate cardiac function, fibrosis signaling pathways (NF-κB, TGF-β1, SMAD3), and collagen deposition. In vitro, both Exo and RA-MSC-Exo treatments significantly restored cell viability and reduced apoptosis in ISO-injured H9C2 cells. In vivo, both treatments significantly mitigated ISO-induced cardiac injury by reducing cardiac biomarkers, decreasing ROS production, and enhancing TAC levels. These interventions downregulated the expression of NF-κB, TGF-β1, Smad3, and Collagen I, leading to attenuated collagen deposition and improved cardiac function. Our study demonstrates that RA-primed exosomes effectively mitigate CF and improve cardiac function in an ISO-induced myocardial ischemia model. This targeted approach offers a promising therapeutic strategy for managing myocardial injury and its fibrotic complications."
