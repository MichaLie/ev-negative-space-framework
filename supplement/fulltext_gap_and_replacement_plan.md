# Full-Text Gap and Replacement Plan

## Current status
- Original top-30 coverage: **29/30** papers.
- Missing original paper: PMID **39938515**, DOI **10.1016/j.cell.2025.01.025**.
- Finalized adjudication set: **42/42** full-text accessible papers (after replacement integration and expansion to all five top-priority axes).

## Impact of missing paper
The missing paper is within the Integrin/Src donor-context block (tumor metastasis). This does **not** collapse the central finding because Integrin/Src donor evidence is already anchored by multiple high-impact full-text papers in the current set:
- PMID 26524530 (Nature, organotropism)
- PMID 36800996 (Developmental Cell, EV biogenesis/metastasis)
- PMID 40632854 (Science Advances, metastasis-impeding EV strategy)
- PMID 40120799 (Cancer Letters, EV biogenesis-metastasis coupling)

## Replacement integration completed
The following replacements are now included in the finalized full-text set:
1. PMID 39329462, DOI **10.1002/jev2.12518** (Integrin alpha6 EVs and premetastatic lymphatic remodeling)
2. PMID 40410902, DOI **10.1186/s13046-025-03418-3** (Organotropic metastatic breast cancer EV-associated DNA/proteins)
3. PMID 39494337, DOI **10.7150/ijbs.94153** (CAV1/integrin alpha6beta4 and lung metastasis)

## Bottom line
You can proceed with high confidence. Core Integrin/Src donor-context evidence is now fully covered in the finalized adjudication set despite the unavailable Cell article.
