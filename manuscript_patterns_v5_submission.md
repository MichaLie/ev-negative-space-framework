## Summary
Pathway-level evidence matures unevenly across disease contexts, creating structured gaps — negative space — invisible to single-domain researchers. We present a reproducible, domain-agnostic framework that quantifies cross-domain pathway asymmetries and converts them into ranked, safety-gated translational hypotheses. The pipeline integrates bibliometric asymmetry mapping, full-text mechanistic adjudication, cargo-confidence scoring, pathway enrichment validation, and clinical-trial surveying, with prespecified sensitivity analyses. Applied to extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling across neurodegeneration, tumor metastasis, and cardiac repair (10 pathway axes; 42 adjudicated texts; 31 scored cargo candidates), the framework identifies Integrin/Src transfer from metastasis to cardiac repair as the top-priority opportunity, stable across all 12 index formulations tested. Full-text adjudication reveals context-dependent functional inversion — identical EV cargo can be pro-metastatic yet cardioprotective — establishing directionality-aware safety gating as essential for cross-domain transfer. All queries, weights, and outputs are publicly archived. The pipeline logic applies wherever structured evidence asymmetry exists across biomedical domains.

**Highlights:**
- Negative-space framework quantifies cross-domain pathway asymmetry
- Integrin/Src ranks #1 across all 12 index formulations tested
- Context-dependent cargo inversion demands safety-gated transfer
- Pipeline is domain-agnostic and fully reproducible

**The bigger picture:**
Biomedical research generates enormous pathway-level knowledge, but this knowledge matures unevenly across disease contexts. A pathway well understood in cancer may be virtually unexplored in heart disease — not because it is irrelevant, but because researchers in different fields rarely quantify each other's gaps. This paper presents a general computational framework that maps these structured blind spots and converts them into ranked, safety-constrained hypotheses for cross-domain experiments. Applied to extracellular vesicle signaling, the framework reveals that cardiac repair is consistently the most evidence-sparse domain for pathways mature in cancer and neurodegeneration research. The same pipeline logic can be applied wherever structured evidence asymmetry exists — from gene therapy to microbiome research — making systematic cross-domain translation accessible to any research group with PubMed access.

## Introduction

### The cross-domain knowledge-transfer problem
Translational biomedicine increasingly recognizes that pathway-level insights from one disease context can inform therapeutic strategies in another. Yet in practice, knowledge remains siloed: researchers in neurodegeneration, oncology, and cardiovascular medicine study overlapping molecular pathways but rarely quantify where one field's mechanistic maturity could benefit another's gaps. This fragmentation is not merely an inconvenience — it represents a systematic missed opportunity, particularly for molecular programs where the biological logic of cross-domain transfer is plausible but the evidence landscape is asymmetric.

The challenge is one of structured visibility. Existing approaches to cross-domain comparison typically catalog shared molecules or pathways, asking "what overlaps?" [1–4]. While valuable for identifying common biology, shared-molecule catalogs are insufficient for translational prioritization because they cannot distinguish pathways that have been equally explored in both contexts from those where deep mechanistic knowledge in one domain coexists with near-absence in another. Nor do they capture a critical safety dimension: the same molecular cargo can produce opposing functional outcomes depending on tissue context and recipient-cell state [5], meaning that direct transfer of pathway components between disease settings carries inherent risk.

### Negative-space mapping as a general framework
We reasoned that a more informative analytical lens is to map the *negative space* of a research landscape: pathway-level signaling programs that are mechanistically mature in one disease domain but remain underdeveloped in another, despite plausible biological transferability. Drawing on evidence gap mapping principles from the systematic review literature [6, 7, 8], we developed a modular pipeline that: (i) quantifies cross-domain pathway asymmetry from bibliometric data, (ii) validates the top-ranked asymmetries with full-text mechanistic adjudication, (iii) grounds candidate cargo in database-verified molecular evidence, (iv) cross-checks pathway assignments via independent enrichment analysis, and (v) surveys the clinical trial landscape for concordance between research gaps and translational gaps. Each layer addresses a specific limitation of the preceding one, and the complete pipeline — including all queries, scoring weights, and decision rules — is designed for transparent reproduction and temporal updating.

The framework is domain-agnostic by design: the pipeline logic requires only that a research landscape can be decomposed into contexts (disease domains) and axes (pathways or molecular programs), with bibliometric queries as input and ranked transfer hypotheses as output. We demonstrate the framework here on extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling across neurodegeneration, tumor metastasis, and cardiac repair — three domains where EVs play mechanistically distinct roles and where cross-domain transfer potential has been discussed qualitatively but never quantified.

### Extracellular vesicles as a demonstration domain
Extracellular vesicles — encompassing exosomes, microvesicles, and other membrane-enclosed particles released by virtually all cell types — have emerged as fundamental mediators of intercellular communication [3, 4]. Over the past decade, research on EV biogenesis, cargo sorting, and uptake has expanded rapidly, revealing that EVs transfer proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids between cells in both physiological and pathological contexts [1, 2]. Critically, EV cargo selection is actively regulated by cellular state and microenvironmental cues, making EVs context-dependent signaling vehicles rather than passive cellular debris [5]. The establishment of community-wide reporting standards through the MISEV guidelines (MISEV2018 and MISEV2023) has improved methodological rigor and cross-study comparability [9, 10].

Three disease domains illustrate the structured asymmetry that motivates this work. In tumor metastasis, EVs are established mediators of organotropism and premetastatic niche conditioning: tumor-derived exosomes carrying MET oncoprotein educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype [11], integrin expression patterns on tumor exosomes predict organ-specific metastatic colonization [12], and cancer-secreted EV miRNAs remodel distant vascular barriers and metabolic niches [13, 14, 15]. In neurodegeneration, EVs have a dual role as disease propagators and diagnostic tools: microglial and neuronal EVs contribute to intercellular spread of misfolded proteins [16, 17], astrocyte-derived EVs mediate complement-dependent neurotoxicity [18], and plasma EV biomarkers are enabling minimally invasive neurodegenerative disease staging [19, 20]. In cardiac repair, EV therapeutics show consistent preclinical benefit: cardiac progenitor cell-derived EVs improve post-infarction function [21], hypoxia-conditioned MSC EVs carrying miR-210 enhance ischemic vascularization [22], and engineered EVs with customized miRNA payloads (e.g., miR-126-loaded small EVs) demonstrate improved cardiac outcomes [23, 24].

Despite this progress, most comparative EV analyses have focused on shared cargo — cataloging overlapping molecules detected across disease contexts [1, 2]. We are not aware of prior EV bibliometric studies that quantitatively rank cross-domain pathway asymmetries and couple those rankings to mechanistic adjudication with safety-gated experimental hypotheses. Although numerous bibliometric analyses of EV research have been published (over 160 as of early 2026 by PubMed count), most address individual disease subtopics or specific applications rather than systematic cross-domain comparison. Here we apply the negative-space framework to this domain, integrating PubMed-derived pathway asymmetry, full-text mechanistic adjudication, database-grounded cargo confidence scoring, pathway enrichment validation, and a clinical trial landscape survey to produce a ranked translational roadmap with explicit safety constraints.

## Results
### 1) Cross-domain EV evidence density is markedly uneven
Cargo-level PubMed counts — broad queries combining the EV core clause with each context and cargo axis, without pathway restriction — revealed a consistent domain hierarchy: tumor metastasis (4,150 protein/proteomic records; 2,408 miRNA) > neurodegeneration (2,661; 840) > cardiac repair (535; 389). The tumor-to-cardiac gap was nearly 8-fold for proteins/proteomics and over 6-fold for miRNA (Figure 1). Temporal trends confirmed that this hierarchy has been stable over the past decade, with all three domains growing but the relative gaps persisting (Figure 2). These unscreened totals represent the broadest evidence envelope; pathway-level counts (below) provide finer resolution and reveal structured, non-uniform patterns of sparsity.


### 2) Pathway-level negative space is quantifiable and structured
When evidence counts were resolved to individual pathway axes, two dominant gap archetypes emerged.

The first archetype comprised metastasis-mature but cardiac-sparse pathways: Integrin/Src, TGF-beta, Wnt, mTOR, NF-kB, and Notch. Integrin/Src showed the strongest asymmetry (255 tumor vs 6 cardiac; smoothed ratio 36.57), followed by TGF-beta (143 vs 12; ratio 11.08) and Wnt (201 vs 20; ratio 9.62). The Integrin/Src gap is biologically notable because integrin-coded EV tropism is mechanistically validated as a driver of metastatic organotropism [12] yet remains virtually unrepresented in cardiac repair research.

The second archetype was a neuro-mature but cardiac-sparse pathway: Autophagy (428 neuro vs 50 cardiac; ratio 8.41). This gap suggests an opportunity to transfer proteostasis-centered EV concepts — well developed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's models — into cardiac regeneration, with appropriate context-specific safety constraints.

A distinct third pattern involved a neuro-sparse axis: Hypoxia/HIF-1 (278 tumor vs 60 neuro), identifying neurovascular and neuroprotective EV applications as an underexplored translational frontier (Figure 3).


### 3) Shared EV pathways are direction-dependent, not universally transferable
Cross-domain pathway overlap does not guarantee functional equivalence. Full-text adjudication and mechanistic exemplars from the screening set revealed context-dependent direction inversion across multiple pathway axes, establishing that directionality awareness is essential for any cross-domain transfer strategy.

The most striking inversion involves miR-21-family signaling. In tumor metastasis, mutant-p53-driven exosomal miR-21-3p promotes pulmonary metastasis through fibroblast activation and reciprocal EMT induction [25], and hypoxia-derived exosomal miR-21 activates cancer-associated fibroblasts to drive metastatic spread [26]. Yet in cardiac repair, exosomal miR-21-5p from cardiac telocytes promotes endothelial survival and angiogenesis after myocardial infarction [23] — the same miRNA family, delivered via EVs, with opposing net biological effects determined by recipient-cell context.

A parallel inversion operates at the pathway level for integrin-mediated EV tropism. Tumor exosome integrins specify organ-targeted metastatic colonization — a pro-invasive program [12]. However, the same tropism logic could in principle be repurposed for cardiac-targeted EV delivery, though indiscriminate transfer of integrin-driven migratory programs into repair settings carries fibrosis and invasion risks. Similarly, TGF-beta EV cargo is net pro-metastatic in tumor microenvironments (mean directionality +0.20, n=5; driving fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and peritoneal dissemination) yet uniformly protective in cardiac repair contexts (modulating fibrosis resolution and post-infarction remodeling) — a pattern confirmed quantitatively by the directionality matrix (Figure 4).

These inversions are not isolated anecdotes. Across the five adjudicated pathway axes, directionality patterns were context-consistent within domains (e.g., all three cardiac TGF-beta papers showed protective directionality; all three Wnt tumor papers showed promoting directionality) but context-inverted between domains. This systematic pattern underscores a key design principle: translational transfer between disease domains should prioritize pathway logic with explicit safety gating rather than direct cargo transplantation.

### 4) A ranked cross-field roadmap with safety constraints
The negative-space priority index, which combines asymmetry ratio with donor-context maturity, yielded an experimentally actionable shortlist. The highest-priority opportunity was Integrin/Src transfer from metastasis to cardiac repair (priority index 12.19), followed by Autophagy transfer from neurodegeneration to cardiac repair (5.61), TGF-beta transfer from metastasis to cardiac repair (3.69), Wnt transfer from metastasis to cardiac repair (3.21), and Hypoxia/HIF-1 transfer from metastasis to neurodegeneration (3.05). Each transfer opportunity was paired with predefined risk gates, including fibrosis, invasion, immune suppression, and aberrant angiogenesis, that should be addressed before efficacy optimization (Figure 5). The complete ranked roadmap is reported in Supplementary Table S4.


### 5) Full-text adjudication confirms roadmap stability
Mechanistic adjudication of 42 full-text papers across the five top-priority pathway axes produced 38 High-confidence and 4 Moderate-confidence classifications under the strict scoring rubric (Supplementary Figure S2). Because these papers were drawn from the highest-ranked pathway-context cells, this distribution reflects the quality of the top evidence stratum rather than the entire screening set.

Axis-level findings reinforced the roadmap rankings. Integrin/Src donor-context evidence was supported by high-impact primary studies spanning integrin-dependent organotropic metastasis [12], ESCRT-mediated exosome biogenesis driving metastatic spread [27], and integrin α6-containing EVs remodeling lymphatic pre-metastatic niches [28]. Target-context cardiac papers demonstrated integrin-linked kinase enrichment in reparative exosomes [29] and Csk-dependent paracrine signaling alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy [30].

Hypoxia/HIF-1 adjudication confirmed robust donor-context evidence in tumor metastasis — hypoxia-driven exosomal miRNA cargo promoting pre-metastatic niches across colorectal, hepatocellular, and prostate cancer models — alongside emerging target-context evidence in neurodegeneration, including HIF-1α-containing exosomes ameliorating Alzheimer's pathology [31], hypoxia-pretreated neural stem cell exosomes attenuating ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease [32], and HIF-1α-targeting interventions reducing amyloid burden [33].

Wnt target-context papers demonstrated exosomal activation of GSK3β/β-catenin signaling in cardiac ischemia–reperfusion models, including a translational porcine myocardial infarction study [34]. Across all five axes, Integrin/Src maintained its position as the highest-priority negative-space target under the baseline index (Figure 5; Supplementary Table S16).


### 6) Sensitivity and robustness analyses
Four prespecified robustness analyses assessed whether the priority rankings are stable to major analytic choices.

**Cardiac-only query relaxation.** Cardiac repair counts were compared across three query variants: strict (injury AND repair terms), relaxed (injury terms only), and broadest (general cardiac disease terms). Cardiac counts increased substantially with relaxation, with Integrin/Src rising from 6 (strict) to 32 (relaxed) to 119 (broadest), Autophagy from 50 to 166 to 319, and TGF-beta from 12 to 63 to 102, representing a 2.1- to 5.3-fold increase depending on pathway. Under the strict query used throughout the paper, cardiac repair was the sparsest domain for 9 of 10 pathways (exception: Hypoxia/HIF-1, where cardiac counts exceeded neurodegeneration). Because this analysis relaxed only the cardiac query while holding neurodegeneration and tumor metastasis at strict stringency, cross-context rank comparisons under relaxed and broadest variants are not interpretable from this analysis alone (Supplementary Table S11).

**Matched-stringency context tiers (all three contexts).** To address cross-context query asymmetry directly, we ran tier-matched strict, relaxed, and broadest query sets across neurodegeneration, tumor metastasis, and cardiac repair simultaneously. Under strict (primary analysis), the top three pathways were Integrin/Src, Autophagy, and TGF-beta; under relaxed, mTOR, Autophagy, and Hypoxia/HIF-1; and under broadest, TGF-beta, mTOR, and Integrin/Src. Rank correlations versus strict were moderate (Spearman 0.6121 for relaxed and 0.6364 for broadest), indicating expected sensitivity to query breadth. However, strict top-5 overlap remained 4/5 under both relaxed and broadest tiers (shared pathways: Integrin/Src, Autophagy, TGF-beta, and Hypoxia/HIF-1), supporting a stable high-priority core despite order shifts (Supplementary Table S15).

**Maturity threshold.** The priority index threshold (>=N records to qualify as a mature context) was varied from 50 to 150. At threshold 50, all 10 pathways received nonzero scores; at 75, Complement, NF-kB, and Notch dropped to zero; at 100 (default), Sphingolipid/Ceramide additionally dropped out; and at 150, TGF-beta also dropped. The top two pathways (Integrin/Src and Autophagy) maintained #1 and #2 ranking across all thresholds, whereas the third position varied between TGF-beta (thresholds 75-100), Hypoxia/HIF-1 (threshold 50), and Wnt (threshold 150), showing sensitivity near the maturity cutoff boundary. A continuous variant (raw smoothed ratio without hard cutoff) retained Integrin/Src at rank #1 and reordered positions #2–4 (TGF-beta, Wnt, Autophagy) relative to the threshold-based index, while assigning nonzero scores to emerging axes such as Sphingolipid/Ceramide (6.37) and Notch (5.33) (Supplementary Table S12).

**Alternative index formulations and smoothing.** We benchmarked 12 formulations spanning smoothing constants (s=0.5, 1.0, 2.0) and four score families (ratio only; ratio multiplied by log total evidence; ratio multiplied by log donor evidence; ratio multiplied by maturity fraction). Integrin/Src remained rank #1 in all 12 formulations. The baseline family (ratio multiplied by maturity fraction) was invariant to smoothing (Spearman=1.00 for s=0.5/1.0/2.0), and 9 of 12 formulations showed Spearman >=0.70 versus baseline (median 0.7516), indicating that top-priority identification is not a single-formula artifact (Supplementary Table S16).

**Integrin/Src axis partition.** Because Integrin/Src combines two mechanistically linked but distinct terms, we partitioned strict-query counts into integrin-only, Src-only, and dual-hit subsets. Integrin-only records dominated in all contexts: neurodegeneration 28/31 (90.32%), tumor metastasis 211/255 (82.75%), and cardiac repair 5/6 (83.33%), while Src-only fractions were smaller (6.45%, 12.94%, and 16.67%, respectively). These data indicate that the axis is not driven by Src-only retrieval, while still supporting future deconvolution into separate translational tracks (Supplementary Table S17).

### 7) Cargo-confidence scoring provides molecular-level corroboration
The bibliometric priority index ranks pathway-level asymmetry but does not assess whether the underlying molecular evidence is well-grounded. The cargo-confidence layer addresses this by scoring 31 prespecified RNA and protein candidates on database-verified criteria independent of the PubMed counts used for prioritization. This layer functions as a molecular-level corroboration check: if a pathway ranks high on the priority index but its candidate cargo molecules lack EV database support, cross-context evidence, or mechanistic anchoring, the prioritization signal should be treated with caution.

All candidates had valid canonical identifiers (31/31), 30/31 had human ExoCarta support, and 27/31 showed evidence in at least two disease contexts. Confidence tiers were 20 High and 11 Moderate (0 Low). Top-ranked candidates included canonical EV markers (CD63, CD81, PDCD6IP, TSG101), pathway hub proteins (AKT1, CTNNB1, MTOR, TGFB1), and high-priority miRNAs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-124-3p, miR-210-3p).

At the pathway level, Integrin/Src remained the highest-confidence negative-space target after cargo-confidence weighting, confirming that the original asymmetry signal is not an artifact of sparse or weakly anchored cargo evidence (Figures 6 and 7). Conversely, pathways where cargo confidence is high but asymmetry is low (e.g., NF-kB; Figure 7 upper-left quadrant) represent well-characterized biology with less cross-domain transfer potential — a distinction that cargo scoring alone would miss without the asymmetry layer.


### 8) Pathway enrichment confirms internal consistency of the cargo panel
To verify that the protein panel's pathway annotations are not artifacts of query construction, the 19-protein subset was submitted to Enrichr for independent over-representation analysis. This serves as an internal consistency check: if the panel were biased by query design rather than reflecting genuine biological coherence, pathway enrichment against curated gene-set libraries would not produce significant results across all framework axes.

The panel produced 115 significantly enriched KEGG pathways and 183 significantly enriched Reactome pathways (adjusted p<0.05). All seven framework axes involving the protein candidates were recovered as independently significant pathways, including focal adhesion/integrin signaling (KEGG Focal adhesion adj p=8.5x10^-6), TGF-beta signaling (KEGG TGF-beta signaling adj p=6.7x10^-3), autophagy/mTOR programs (KEGG Autophagy adj p=7.4x10^-4), and Wnt signaling (Reactome Signaling by WNT adj p=1.4x10^-3). The KEGG NF-kappa B signaling pathway did not reach significance as a named pathway (adj p=0.105), though NFKB1 contributed to multiple other significantly enriched pathways. The top-ranked KEGG pathway overall was Proteoglycans in cancer (adj p=1.1x10^-9; 8/19 genes), and Endocytosis was also significantly enriched (adj p=2.6x10^-4), capturing EV biogenesis machinery alongside signaling components. Full results are presented in Supplementary Table S13.

We note that this analysis has a degree of circularity: the proteins were selected partly because of their pathway associations. The enrichment therefore confirms that the panel is coherent and well-curated — it does not independently discover pathway assignments. Its value lies in ruling out the specific concern that query-construction artifacts inflated the panel's apparent pathway coverage.

### 9) Clinical translation gap mirrors research negative space
The translational gap identified by bibliometric analysis extends into the clinical development pipeline. A recent systematic review found that the EV clinical trial landscape remains dominated by early-phase studies and biomarker discovery, with limited pathway-specific targeting [35]. Our ClinicalTrials.gov survey (accessed February 2026) quantified this gap: of 444 registered EV trials (255 interventional), domain-specific searches revealed 18 cardiac + EV trials (only 2 interventional for myocardial infarction, including a Phase 1/2 trial of MSC-derived exosomes co-transplanted with mitochondria [NCT05669144]), 24 neurodegeneration + EV trials (with a Phase 1 trial of hUC-MSC-derived small EV nasal drops for multiple neurodegenerative diseases [NCT06607900]), and 23 metastasis + EV trials (predominantly observational/diagnostic). Critically, only 2 trials combined EVs with any of the top-priority pathway targets (integrin, TGF-beta, autophagy), and both were observational studies. This near-absence of pathway-targeted interventional EV trials is consistent with the translational negative space identified by our bibliometric analysis, though causality cannot be inferred — the clinical gap may reflect independent regulatory, manufacturing, or funding barriers rather than a direct consequence of basic-research sparsity.

Pharmacological tractability of the top-priority pathway targets further supports the feasibility of negative-space-guided experiments. Src kinase, the signaling partner in the highest-ranked Integrin/Src axis, has an approved inhibitor (dasatinib, FDA-approved 2006; ChEMBL:CHEMBL1421), while TGF-beta receptor type I (TGFBR1) has at least two small-molecule inhibitors in Phase 2 clinical trials (ChEMBL:CHEMBL4439). The availability of validated pharmacological tools for these targets means that pathway-modulation experiments in cardiac repair models can be designed with existing compounds rather than requiring de novo drug development.

### 10) Experimental starter-kit table translates rankings into testable designs
To make the roadmap directly actionable, we assembled a falsifiable experimental starter-kit for the top five strict-priority axes (Integrin/Src, Autophagy, TGF-beta, Wnt, Hypoxia/HIF-1). For each axis, the table specifies transfer direction, donor- and target-context anchor PMIDs, recommended initial EV source classes, recipient model stack (in vitro plus in vivo), primary efficacy endpoints, mandatory safety gates, minimum EV characterization requirements, and explicit falsification criteria. This converts ranked asymmetry signals into concrete first-pass study designs while preserving safety-gated interpretation (Supplementary Table S18).

## Discussion
### A general framework, demonstrated in EV biology
This study introduces negative-space mapping as a quantitative approach for identifying structured translational opportunities across biomedical domains. Rather than asking what is shared between disease contexts — the default strategy in most comparative analyses [1, 2] — the framework asks what is *asymmetrically developed* and therefore represents a transfer opportunity with defined direction, priority, and risk constraints.

The approach addresses a pervasive problem in translational research: mature pathway knowledge in one disease context frequently remains siloed, invisible to researchers in adjacent fields who could benefit from it. Evidence gap mapping is well established in public health and development research [7], but its application to molecular signaling landscapes is virtually unprecedented. By quantifying this invisibility, negative-space analysis converts an abstract concern ("we should collaborate more across fields") into a concrete, ranked priority list that can inform experimental planning.

The pipeline's modular architecture is intentionally designed for reuse beyond EV biology. Any research landscape that can be decomposed into disease contexts and molecular axes — metabolomics across autoimmune diseases, gene-therapy vector tropism across organ systems, microbiome–host signaling across gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric conditions — could be analyzed with the same five-layer logic: bibliometric asymmetry → mechanistic adjudication → candidate-level confidence scoring → pathway enrichment consistency check → clinical landscape concordance. The framework requires only PubMed-queryable literature and publicly available molecular databases as inputs, and all decision rules (query strings, scoring weights, maturity thresholds) are prespecified and modifiable. We encourage other groups to adapt the pipeline to their domains and to report where the framework succeeds and where it requires modification.

### Structured asymmetry, not uniform sparsity
The central empirical finding from the EV demonstration is that research is not uniformly underdeveloped; it is unevenly developed in recognizable, measurable patterns. Cardiac repair consistently emerged as the most evidence-sparse domain for pathways well established in tumor metastasis (Integrin/Src, TGF-beta, Wnt) and neurodegeneration (Autophagy), while neurodegeneration was relatively sparse for Hypoxia/HIF-1 compared with tumor metastasis. This structured asymmetry has a critical practical implication: it suggests specific, testable transfer hypotheses rather than a general call for more research. A ranked priority list may help funders, reviewers, and experimentalists focus cross-domain efforts more efficiently than a broad appeal for interdisciplinary collaboration.

### The priority index: deliberate simplicity as a design choice
The priority index formula (asymmetry ratio × maturity fraction) is deliberately simple, and this simplicity is a feature rather than a limitation. More sophisticated approaches — Bayesian ranking, field-normalized citation analysis [36], machine-learning-based bibliometric classifiers, or natural-language-processing-driven claim extraction — could refine the rankings but would reduce the pipeline's transparency and reproducibility for non-specialist users. We intentionally prioritized a formula that any research group can understand, critique, modify, and re-run with updated data — a design choice aligned with the principle that useful prioritization tools should be maximally transparent rather than maximally sophisticated.

The robustness of this simple approach is empirically supported. Integrin/Src remained rank #1 across all 12 alternative formulation/smoothing combinations, 9 of 12 formulations showed Spearman >=0.70 versus baseline (median 0.7516), and the top two rankings were invariant to smoothing constant choice. That a deliberately minimal formula produces rankings stable across diverse alternatives suggests that the underlying asymmetry signal is strong enough to be captured without sophisticated modeling — the complexity, in this case, is in the data rather than in the method. Where rankings do shift (positions 3–5 under alternative weighting schemes), the instability itself is informative, identifying pathways where priority depends on analytic assumptions and cautioning against over-interpretation of fine rank order.

### Directionality inversion demands safety-gated transfer
A key biological insight from this work is that shared EV cargo can exhibit context-dependent functional inversion, making safety gating an essential component of any cross-domain transfer strategy. The miR-21 family provides the clearest illustration: mutant-p53-driven exosomal miR-21-3p promotes pulmonary metastasis through fibroblast activation and reciprocal EMT induction [25], while exosomal miR-21-5p from cardiac telocytes promotes endothelial survival and angiogenesis after infarction [23]. This inversion is not limited to individual miRNAs — it operates at the pathway level, with TGF-beta EV cargo showing net pro-metastatic directionality yet uniformly protective effects in cardiac repair, and Wnt EV signaling showing the same pattern. Integrin-coded EV tropism drives metastatic organotropism but could potentially be repurposed for cardiac-targeted delivery, though indiscriminate transfer of migratory programs into repair settings carries fibrosis and invasion risks.

These are not edge cases — they likely reflect a broader pattern in EV biology where the same molecular cargo produces opposing outcomes depending on recipient-cell state and tissue microenvironment [5]. Our directionality analysis, covering five pathways with full-text evidence, demonstrates that within-domain directionality is consistent (all cardiac TGF-beta papers are protective; all tumor Wnt papers are promoting) while between-domain directionality is frequently inverted. This systematic pattern establishes a design principle with implications beyond EV research: translational transfer between disease domains should prioritize pathway design logic with explicit risk gates rather than direct cargo transplantation. This principle should not be over-generalized to the remaining five axes without dedicated adjudication, but the pattern is sufficiently consistent to warrant it as a default framework assumption.

### Early target-context evidence validates the transfer hypothesis
A particularly encouraging finding is that emerging primary studies in the underexplored contexts already provide proof-of-concept for the cross-domain transfers our framework prioritizes. For Integrin/Src → cardiac repair, full-text adjudication identified integrin-linked kinase enrichment in endothelial progenitor cell exosomes modulating cardiac repair [29] and Csk-dependent paracrine signaling via EVs alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy [30]. For Autophagy → cardiac repair, iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte exosomes promote autophagy for myocardial repair [37], and MSC-derived exosomal miR-143-3p suppresses ischemia–reperfusion injury by regulating autophagy [38]. For Hypoxia/HIF-1 → neurodegeneration, HIF-1α-containing exosomes ameliorate Alzheimer's pathology [31], and hypoxia-pretreated neural stem cell exosomes attenuate ferroptosis in Parkinson's models [32]. For Wnt → cardiac repair, exosomal activation of GSK3β/β-catenin signaling has been demonstrated in a translational porcine myocardial infarction study [34].

These examples are published, peer-reviewed studies that occupy the negative-space zones our framework prioritizes. While this convergence between bibliometric prediction and emerging empirical validation is encouraging, it should be interpreted cautiously: the adjudication sample is small, and retrospective alignment does not guarantee prospective predictive power. A rigorous test of the framework's predictive utility would require a prospective design — freezing the priority rankings at a given date and assessing whether subsequent high-impact publications disproportionately emerge from the predicted negative-space zones. We propose this as a key validation target for future work.

### The Integrin/Src axis: highest priority with mechanistic nuance
The Integrin/Src axis merits particular attention. While it ranks highest on the priority index, the query combines integrin-mediated adhesion/trafficking with Src kinase signaling. These are mechanistically linked — integrin engagement frequently activates Src family kinases — but they represent distinct therapeutic targets with different safety profiles. Our partition analysis showed that integrin-only records dominate the combined axis in all three contexts (83–90%), with Src-only records as a minority component, reducing concern that the top rank is a Src-only retrieval artifact. Even so, future work should deconvolve these axes explicitly, particularly for cardiac-directed EV engineering strategies that leverage integrin specificity while minimizing pro-migratory signaling.

### Reproducibility and the MISEV-era imperative
This framework was designed to align with MISEV-era standards for transparency and reproducibility [9, 10]. Every component — the query registry, screening rules, scoring weights, and pathway rankings — is fully specified in supplementary files, enabling independent groups to reproduce, critique, and extend the analysis. The pipeline is designed for temporal updating: re-running the queries with a new date window yields a current atlas without methodological changes. We envision periodic updates (e.g., annually) that track how the negative-space landscape evolves as new research fills identified gaps, providing a living metric of cross-domain translational progress.

### Limitations
Several methodological limitations should be considered when interpreting these results.

First, literature density is a proxy for research attention, not direct effect size or biological importance. A pathway with low PubMed counts in a given context may reflect genuine research sparsity, restrictive query design, or both. The negative-space framework identifies where research has been concentrated and where it has not, but cannot by itself distinguish between "unexplored because unimportant" and "unexplored despite high potential." This is a fundamental constraint of bibliometric approaches: the framework generates hypotheses about where productive research might occur, not proof that it will.

Second, the three context queries differ in logical stringency. The neurodegeneration clause uses broader OR logic across disease names, while the cardiac repair clause requires AND logic between injury and repair/regeneration terms. This can underestimate strict cardiac counts. Cardiac-only relaxation increased counts 2.1- to 5.3-fold across pathways. A matched-stringency analysis across all three contexts (strict, relaxed, broadest tiers) reduced but did not remove the asymmetry narrative: rank correlations versus strict were moderate (Spearman 0.6121 and 0.6364), and strict top-5 overlap was 4/5 in both relaxed and broadest tiers. These results support a stable high-priority core but also show that fine rank order is query-sensitive and should not be over-interpreted as absolute. Additionally, a post-hoc word-boundary audit flagged 37/320 neurodegeneration screening rows as potential substring-driven false positives (e.g., "als" matching non-ALS terms); the pipeline code has been updated with word-boundary matching to prevent this in future runs (`supplement/neuro_context_false_positives_wordboundary.csv`).

Third, the priority index uses a hard maturity threshold (≥ 100 records), creating a discontinuity where emerging pathways narrowly below the cutoff (e.g., Sphingolipid/Ceramide at 90 neurodegeneration records) receive zero scores. Threshold sensitivity confirmed that the top two pathways (Integrin/Src and Autophagy) are robust across 50 to 150, though the third-ranked pathway varies with cutoff. The 100-record boundary should be interpreted as a pragmatic filter, not a biological threshold.

Fourth, full-text adjudication covered 42 of 813 unique PMIDs (5.2%) across 5 of 10 pathway axes. This was designed as a validation spot-check of the highest-ranked records, not a comprehensive assessment. The high mechanistic-confidence rates (38 High, 4 Moderate) reflect the quality of the top evidence stratum and should not be generalized to the entire screening set. Five pathway axes (mTOR, Notch, NF-kB, Complement, Sphingolipid/Ceramide) remain without full-text adjudication and represent priorities for future work.

Fifth, the RNA/protein confidence layer and Integrin/Src axis partition share a common design philosophy: both use prespecified criteria rather than empirically optimized parameters. The cargo-confidence component weights (0.25/0.25/0.25/0.15/0.10) were fixed a priori, and the Integrin/Src axis combines mechanistically linked but therapeutically distinct programs (integrin-only studies represent 83–90% of the combined signal). Alternative weighting schemes may yield different candidate rankings, and deconvolution of integrin and Src as separate axes is warranted in future iterations, though pathway-level conclusions are less sensitive to individual candidate scores than to the underlying count asymmetry.

Finally, no formal statistical inference (confidence intervals, multiple-testing correction) was applied to the priority index or cargo-confidence scores. The atlas is a prioritization tool intended to guide rigorous downstream experimentation, not a definitive ranking of biological importance.

### Conclusion
Cross-domain biomedical research generates substantial mechanistic knowledge, but this knowledge is unevenly distributed across disease contexts in patterns that are quantifiable, structured, and actionable. Negative-space mapping — identifying pathway programs mature in one domain but underexplored in another — offers a general framework for converting this asymmetry into ranked translational hypotheses with explicit safety constraints. Applied to EV signaling across neurodegeneration, tumor metastasis, and cardiac repair, the framework identifies cardiac repair as the primary beneficiary of cross-domain transfer and reveals that directionality-aware safety gating is essential to prevent context-inappropriate cargo deployment. The convergence between bibliometric predictions and emerging experimental validation in target contexts is consistent with the prospective utility of this approach, though larger-scale and ideally prospective validation is needed. With full reproducibility, modular architecture, and domain-agnostic pipeline logic, the framework offers a concrete starting point for systematic cross-domain translational prioritization — one that can be adopted, adapted, and stress-tested by the broader research community.

### Method Details

#### Study design
This was a quantitative evidence-synthesis study combining PubMed-based bibliometric mapping with database-grounded cargo validation and independent pathway enrichment. The study was designed as a framework demonstration: the analytical pipeline is domain-agnostic, while the specific queries and pathway axes are tailored to EV biology across three disease contexts. All queries, screening outputs, and analysis scripts are provided in Supplementary Materials for full reproducibility.

#### Query architecture
PubMed E-utilities were queried with a date window of January 1, 2015 to February 15, 2026. The core EV clause — `(extracellular vesicle OR exosome OR exosomes)` — was combined with three disease-context clauses:

The neurodegeneration clause used disease terms (Alzheimer, Parkinson, ALS, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington) joined by OR logic. The tumor metastasis clause required cancer/tumor terms combined with metastasis-related terms by AND logic. The cardiac repair clause required myocardial or cardiac injury-state terms combined with repair/regeneration/cardioprotection terms, also by AND logic.

Each context clause was crossed with two cargo axes (proteins/proteomics and miRNA) and ten pathway axes (mTOR, Wnt, Notch, NF-kB, complement, sphingolipid/ceramide, autophagy, hypoxia/HIF-1, Integrin/Src, and TGF-beta). Lipid/sphingolipid terms were retained in background pathway mapping but excluded from the translational cargo-confidence layer. Full query strings are provided in Supplementary Table S2.

#### Screening and quality control
For each of the 30 pathway-context cells (10 pathways x 3 contexts), up to 40 PubMed records by relevance were retrieved. Title, abstract, publication type, DOI, and journal metadata were extracted. Screening required explicit context-keyword and pathway-keyword matches in title or abstract, prioritized primary research publication types over reviews/editorials/commentaries for the high-confidence set, and incorporated mechanistic-language enrichment for mediation, transfer, or regulatory phrasing. This process yielded 929 total records (813 unique PMIDs), of which 386 were classified as high-relevance primary records (Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S3).

#### Full-text mechanistic adjudication
To validate roadmap rankings at the primary-evidence level, 42 full-text-accessible papers spanning the five top-priority pathway axes were adjudicated: Integrin/Src (n=11), Autophagy (n=10), TGF-beta (n=8), Hypoxia/HIF-1 (n=7), and Wnt (n=6). Papers were selected to balance donor-context evidence (mechanistically mature domain) and target-context evidence (underexplored domain) within each axis. For each paper, structured adjudication fields were extracted, including model class (in vivo, in vitro, and human samples), causal perturbation evidence, EV isolation and marker characterization, context-endpoint alignment, and directionality proxy (promoting, protective, or mixed). Each paper received a mechanistic confidence score (High: >=7/8 criteria met; Moderate: 5-6 criteria met). The complete adjudication set and extraction table are provided in Supplementary Table S8. This layer served as a robustness check for roadmap stability rather than a formal meta-analysis.
For pathway-context directionality aggregation, cells with zero adjudicated papers (n=0) were retained as missing values and rendered as NA in Figure 4 rather than encoded as zero.

#### RNA/protein cargo-confidence layer
To move beyond bibliometric ranking alone, a candidate-level confidence layer was constructed for 31 RNA and protein cargo markers (12 miRNAs, 19 proteins). The panel was assembled by requiring each candidate to satisfy three inclusion criteria: established presence in the EV cargo literature (ExoCarta annotation or high-frequency PubMed co-occurrence with EV terms), functional association with at least one of the ten pathway axes, and evidence in at least two of the three disease contexts. Canonical EV markers (CD63, CD81, PDCD6IP, TSG101) were included as positive controls. The panel was designed for structured prioritization rather than exhaustive coverage and can be expanded using the same pipeline.

Each candidate was scored on five prespecified components with fixed weights: identifier validity (0.25; miRBase [39] for RNA and UniProt [40] reviewed human entries for proteins), ExoCarta [41] human EV support and experiment depth (0.25; Vesiclepedia [42] v5.1 served as an independent concordance check), PubMed breadth across the three disease contexts (0.25), mechanistic query enrichment including title-level support from the full-text adjudication set (0.15), and biomarker query enrichment (0.10). Identifier validity and ExoCarta presence functioned primarily as inclusion gates (31/31 and 30/31 pass, respectively), while effective ranking was driven by breadth, mechanistic enrichment, and biomarker readiness. Composite scores were scaled to 0-100 and tiered as High (>=70), Moderate (40-69.9), or Low (<40). Full query logs and scoring manifests are provided in Supplementary Table S9 and Supplementary File S10.

#### Pathway enrichment consistency check
As an internal consistency check on the panel's pathway annotations, the 19-protein subset was submitted to the Enrichr REST API [43, 44] for over-representation analysis against the KEGG_2021_Human and Reactome_2022 gene-set libraries. Enrichment p-values were corrected for multiple testing (Benjamini–Hochberg), and pathways with adjusted p < 0.05 were retained. This step tests whether the protein panel statistically over-represents the pathway axes defined by the PubMed query architecture. Because the proteins were selected partly on the basis of pathway association, significant enrichment confirms panel coherence and curation quality but does not constitute independent pathway discovery.

#### Negative-space prioritization
For each pathway axis, a smoothed asymmetry ratio was computed as (max_count + s) / (min_count + s) across the three disease contexts, where additive smoothing prevents division by zero (default s = 1.0). The priority index was defined as:

priority_index = ((max_count + s) / (min_count + s)) * (contexts_ge100 / 3)

where contexts_ge100 is the number of disease contexts with at least 100 records. This favors pathways with both strong cross-domain asymmetry and mature donor-context evidence. Sensitivity analyses tested alternative maturity thresholds (50-150), matched-stringency context tiers across all three domains, alternative index formulations/smoothing, and Integrin/Src keyword partitioning. The ranked roadmap is provided in Supplementary Table S4; robustness outputs are provided in Supplementary Tables S11-S18.

#### Clinical-trial landscape survey
ClinicalTrials.gov was queried on February 15, 2026 with prespecified EV terms ("extracellular vesicle", "extracellular vesicles", exosome, exosomes) alone and in combination with each disease-context clause (cardiac repair, neurodegeneration, tumor/metastasis). Trials were stratified by registry study type (interventional vs observational), and pathway-targeted subsets were identified with prespecified keyword filters (integrin, TGF-beta, autophagy). The structured query snapshot used for manuscript counts and exemplar NCT entries is provided in `clinicaltrials_ev_snapshot.json`.

### Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses are described in the relevant Method Details subsections. Briefly: the priority index is a deterministic formula (asymmetry ratio × maturity fraction) without probabilistic inference. Sensitivity analyses tested 12 alternative formulations with Spearman rank correlation as the stability metric. Pathway enrichment used Enrichr with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (adjusted p < 0.05). No formal power analysis was performed as this is a bibliometric prioritization study, not a hypothesis-testing experiment.

## Figure Legends
**Figure 1. Cargo-class literature density by disease context.** Grouped bar chart showing PubMed record counts for three cargo classes (proteins/proteomics, miRNA, lipids/lipidomics) across neurodegeneration (blue), tumor metastasis (orange), and cardiac repair (green). These represent unscreened cargo-level counts from broad two-term queries (EV clause + context clause + cargo clause) without pathway restriction. Tumor metastasis dominates all three cargo classes, with the largest absolute gap in proteins/proteomics (4,150 tumor vs 535 cardiac; ~8-fold). Source data: pipeline output counts. File: `figure1_cargo_context_bars.png`.

**Figure 2. Annual EV literature growth by disease context (2010–2026).** Line chart showing the temporal trajectory of EV-related PubMed publications across neurodegeneration (blue), tumor metastasis (orange), and cardiac repair (green). All three domains show sustained growth since ~2014, but the relative gaps have persisted: tumor metastasis consistently leads, followed by neurodegeneration, with cardiac repair remaining the smallest contributor. The 2026 data point is partial (January–February only). Source data: pipeline temporal output. File: `figure2_annual_growth_contexts.png`.

**Figure 3. Pathway-level EV evidence density across three disease contexts.** Heatmap showing PubMed record counts for each of ten pathway axes (rows) across neurodegeneration, tumor metastasis, and cardiac repair (columns). Counts reflect EV-specific queries combining the core EV clause, context clause, and pathway clause (date window: January 2015 – February 2026). Color intensity scales with evidence density; numerical values are displayed in each cell. The heatmap reveals structured asymmetry — e.g., Integrin/Src is highly developed in tumor metastasis (255) but virtually absent in cardiac repair (6), while Autophagy is neuro-mature (428) but cardiac-sparse (50). Source data: `negative_space_priority_index.csv`. File: `figure3_pathway_heatmap.png`.

**Figure 4. Directionality signal by pathway and context from full-text adjudication.** Heatmap showing the mean directionality proxy score (−1.0 = uniformly protective/inhibitory, 0 = neutral/mixed, +1.0 = uniformly promoting) for each of five adjudicated pathways across three disease contexts. Based on structured extraction from 42 full-text papers. Cells with no adjudicated papers (n=0) are displayed as NA rather than 0.00. The matrix highlights context-dependent direction inversion: e.g., TGF-beta and Wnt EV cargo is net promoting (+0.20 and +1.00) in tumor metastasis but protective (−1.00) in cardiac repair. These inversions inform the safety-gating recommendations in the translational roadmap. Source data: `supplement/directionality_proxy_scores_with_counts.csv` (means + n per cell). File: `figure4_directionality_matrix_final.png`.

**Figure 5. Negative-space priority index by EV pathway.** Horizontal bar chart ranking the ten pathway axes by their negative-space priority index (asymmetry ratio × maturity fraction). Integrin/Src has the highest priority (12.19), followed by Autophagy (5.61), TGF-beta (3.69), Wnt (3.21), and Hypoxia/HIF-1 (3.05). Four pathways (Complement, NF-kB, Notch, Sphingolipid/Ceramide) receive zero scores under the default maturity threshold (≥ 100 records) because no context exceeds this threshold. Sensitivity analyses (Results §6) show that these pathways receive nonzero scores under alternative thresholds and a continuous maturity function. Source data: `negative_space_priority_index.csv`. File: `figure5_negative_space_priority.png`.

**Figure 6. RNA/protein cargo confidence scores for 31 EV candidates.** Horizontal bar chart showing composite confidence scores (0–100 scale) for each of 31 prespecified RNA and protein candidates, color-coded by cargo type (protein, blue; RNA, orange). Scores integrate five components: identifier validity, ExoCarta human EV support, PubMed cross-context breadth, mechanistic enrichment, and biomarker readiness. The High-confidence tier (≥ 70) includes 20 candidates, and the Moderate tier (40–69.9) includes 11 candidates. Canonical EV markers (CD63, CD81) rank highest; the vertical line at 70 marks the High/Moderate tier boundary. Source data: `cargo_confidence_rna_protein.csv`. File: `figure6_cargo_confidence_scores.png`.

**Figure 7. Pathway negative-space priority versus mean cargo confidence.** Scatter plot integrating the two independent scoring dimensions: negative-space priority index (x-axis) and mean cargo confidence for associated candidates (y-axis). Bubble size is proportional to pathway evidence mass. Integrin/Src occupies the highest-priority position (high asymmetry, moderate cargo confidence), while Autophagy combines high priority with the highest mean cargo confidence. Pathways in the upper-left quadrant (e.g., NF-kB) have strong cargo evidence but low asymmetry, while lower-right quadrant pathways would indicate high asymmetry with weak cargo grounding. This two-dimensional view demonstrates that cargo confidence and bibliometric asymmetry capture complementary information: neither dimension alone is sufficient for translational prioritization. Source data: `negative_space_with_cargo_confidence.csv`. File: `figure7_negative_space_vs_cargo_confidence.png`.
